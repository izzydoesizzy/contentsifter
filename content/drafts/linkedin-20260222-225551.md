# Achievement Mining for Content and PR Roles: Think in Volume + Impact

*Format: linkedin*

---

Your content resume bullets are putting hiring managers to sleep.

I see this garbage ALL the time:
→ "Generated high-quality content including articles and blog posts"
→ "Managed communications initiatives" 
→ "Created engaging social media content"

snooze fest

Hiring managers are doom scrolling right past this.

Here's how to wake them up:

Think VOLUME + IMPACT. Not vague responsibilities.

❌ "Wrote blog content"
✅ "Authored 85+ blog posts over 18 months, driving 40% increase in organic traffic"

❌ "Managed executive communications" 
✅ "Secured 12 speaking opportunities for C-suite leaders at industry conferences with 5,000+ attendees"

❌ "Created social content"
✅ "Produced 15 posts weekly across 4 platforms, growing follower base from 2K to 18K in 8 months"

"But Izzy, I don't remember the exact numbers.."

So what?

Do the math. 

1 blog post per week for 2 years? That's 104 posts.

Email campaigns averaging 25% open rates with 5,000 subscribers? That's 1,250 engaged readers per send.

Your work had MASSIVE impact.

Stop hiding it behind "detail-oriented" bullshit.
