"Stop sending connection requests like you're handing out flyers at a mall."

[VISUAL: Cut to LinkedIn screen, generic "I'd like to add you to my network"]

"Here's what I want you to do instead. Five to seven personalized connection requests. Every. Single. Day."

[VISUAL: Text overlay — "5-7 per day"]

"And I mean personalized. Reference their actual work. Something like — 'Hey Sarah, I saw your data migration project at Shopify, and as someone breaking into tech, I'm genuinely inspired by the path you took. I'd love to connect.'"

"That's it. That's the whole system. And here's the math — you'd be surprised. Five a day for three months? That's four hundred and fifty warm connections. All with personalized openers. All remembering how you showed up."

[VISUAL: Text overlay — "450+ connections in 90 days"]

"This is the lowest-hanging fruit in your entire job search. Consistency over intensity."

"Save this. Try it for one week. Then follow for more."
