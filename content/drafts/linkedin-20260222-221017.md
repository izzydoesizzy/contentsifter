# Q: How Do I Handle a 'Job Hopping' Resume Without Explaining It Away?

*Format: linkedin*

---

Stop apologizing for your "winding" career path.

I had the same conversation twice this week with clients who felt like their resume screamed "job hopper."

Different industries. Short stints. Career pivots.

"Nobody's going to want to hire me with this mess of a background."

Here's the thing. What you're seeing as a mess? That's not how the RIGHT employer sees it.

But you've got to stop seeing yourself in this light that's like "tainted, nobody's going to hire me."

Your diverse experience isn't a bug, it's a feature.

Here's what I want you to do:

Find your common thread 
Even if the industries are all over the place, your skills and approach stay consistent. Name it explicitly: "I've built successful teams across three different industries. What's consistent is HOW I approach the work."

Lead with value, not apology 
Your breadth of experience? That equals adaptability. Cross-functional perspective. Pattern recognition across markets. That's GOLD to the right company.

Target companies that actually value versatility 
Some cultures prize deep specialization. Others are like "give me someone who can think across different domains." Your job is to find the ones that need what YOU bring.

Connect with people who've walked similar paths 
They've navigated the exact same objections. They'll share what framing actually worked for them.

The goal isn't to justify your history.

It's to make the value of your history undeniable.
