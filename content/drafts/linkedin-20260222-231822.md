# Rejection Therapy TED Talk: Ask for Everything, Fear Nothing

*Format: linkedin*

---

I watched this TED Talk 3 years ago and it CHANGED how I coach networking.

The speaker challenged himself to get rejected once a day for 100 days.

His asks were deliberately ridiculous:
→ Asked a security guard to borrow $100
→ Asked Krispy Kreme to make Olympic ring donuts
→ Asked to play soccer in someone's backyard

The goal wasn't to get a YES.

It was to remove the emotional weight of NO.

Here's what blew my mind:

Some of those "ridiculous" asks got a YES.

Krispy Kreme made the donuts.

The homeowner let him play soccer.

Opportunities appeared out of nowhere. Not despite the audacious asks, but BECAUSE of them.

This is exactly why most job seekers stay stuck in that hamster wheel.

Fear of rejection keeps you from:
✅ Messaging that hiring manager directly
✅ Asking for an informational interview 
✅ Reaching out to senior people in your network
✅ Asking for the promotion you deserve

Here's the thing. Rejection isn't personal.

It's just data.

That person who says no to your LinkedIn message? They're not rejecting YOU. They're rejecting a request at a specific moment in time.

Every no gets you closer to the yes that changes everything.

So what am I asking you to do this week?

Make ONE ask that feels slightly uncomfortable.

Send that message.
Ask for that introduction.
Apply for that "reach" role.

Just ask.

The worst they can say is no. And we already know that's not about you.
