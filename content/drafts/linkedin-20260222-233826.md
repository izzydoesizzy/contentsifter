# ClearCareer Survey: 95% Transformative Impact, $20K Average Salary Increase

*Format: linkedin*

---

I asked 200 ClearCareer alumni one simple question.

"Did this actually work?"

47 responses came back in 24 hours. And holy moly, here's what they said:

→ 95% rated the program 5/5 for impact
→ 85% said ClearCareer outperformed every other job search resource they'd tried
→ Confidence scores jumped from 2.4 to 4.5 after joining
→ 75% overcame their biggest challenge (resume, interviews, confidence, unclear direction)
→ Average salary increase of $20,000. One member gained over $100K.

But here's the stat that hit me hardest.

60% of members who received offers submitted fewer than 10 applications.

Let that sink in.

Not 200 applications. Not doom-scrolling job boards for 6 months straight.

TEN. Or less.

That tells me something really important. People aren't just getting hired faster. They're getting FOCUSED. Going after the right roles, the right way, and landing them without burning themselves out in the process.

And 50% secured 6+ interviews after the program. Compared to the majority who had 0-5 before joining.

We went from "nobody's calling me back" to "I have OPTIONS."

This is exactly why I keep saying quality beats quantity every single time in a job search.

You don't need to apply everywhere.

You need a clear target, a compelling story, and the confidence to go after it.

That's what we build together.
