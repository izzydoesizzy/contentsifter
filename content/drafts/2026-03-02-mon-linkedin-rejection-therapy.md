# Rejection Therapy: Ask for Everything, Fear Nothing

I watched a TED Talk that changed how I coach job seekers.

Jia Jiang decided to get rejected once a day for 100 days straight. On purpose.

He asked a security guard to borrow $100. He walked into Krispy Kreme and asked them to make donuts shaped like the Olympic rings.

Here's the thing — Krispy Kreme actually made them.

Some of his most ridiculous asks got a yes. But that wasn't even the point. The point was that after weeks of deliberate rejection, the word "no" lost its power over him.

I think about this constantly when I'm working with job seekers.

The reality is, fear of rejection is the #1 reason people don't reach out to hiring managers. It's why they don't message that VP on LinkedIn. It's why they don't ask for the informational interview. It's why they don't follow up after being ghosted.

We treat "no" like it's a verdict on who we are. It's not. It's just a word.

You don't need 100 days of rejection therapy. But you could start small this week. Ask for something you'd normally talk yourself out of. Ask someone for coffee. Ask a stranger for directions. Ask for a discount at a store.

Train your nervous system to handle "no" so it stops running the show.

Because here's what I tell every client: if nobody knows what you want, you're never going to get it.

Ask for help. Ask for the thing you actually want. The worst they can say is no — and now you know that's survivable.

Keep showing up.
