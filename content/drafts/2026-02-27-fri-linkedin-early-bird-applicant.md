# Apply on Company Websites BEFORE Job Boards

*Format: LinkedIn text post | Week of 2026-02-23 | Friday — Testimonial Day*

Here's the thing about job searching that most people get wrong:

They wait for the job to come to them.

They scroll Indeed. They scroll LinkedIn. They hit "Easy Apply" and hope for the best.

But by the time a role hits the big job boards, hundreds — sometimes thousands — of people are already applying.

You're not late. But you're not early either.

One of the folks in our program tested something I've been coaching for a while: go directly to company websites and apply there FIRST.

What they found blew them away.

At least 6 of the roles they applied for on company career pages showed up on Indeed 5-7 days LATER. By the time the flood of applicants hit, their application was already in the system. Already being reviewed. Already ahead.

That's not a hack. That's just how hiring works.

Most companies post on their own careers page first. Then it trickles out to the aggregators. That 5-7 day window? That's your competitive advantage.

Here's what I want you to do this week:

1. Pick 5 companies you're genuinely interested in
2. Go to their careers page directly
3. Set up job alerts on THEIR site
4. Apply before the rest of the world even knows the role exists

You'd be surprised how much of job searching comes down to timing and intentionality — not just qualifications.

Stop waiting for the algorithm to serve you opportunities. Go find them at the source.

Keep showing up. But show up early.
