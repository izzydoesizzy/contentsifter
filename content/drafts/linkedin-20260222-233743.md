# Rejection Therapy TED Talk: Ask for Everything, Fear Nothing

*Format: linkedin*

---

The #1 reason you're not getting the job?

You're not asking.

Not for the referral. Not for the intro. Not for the quick chat with the hiring manager.

Because asking feels terrifying. And "no" feels like a full-on catastrophe.

Here's a TED Talk I send to clients ALL. THE. TIME.

Jia Jiang challenged himself to get rejected at least once a day for 100 days straight.

His asks were deliberately ridiculous:
→ Asked a security guard to borrow $100
→ Asked Krispy Kreme to make Olympic ring-shaped donuts

The goal wasn't the yes. It was to rewire his brain so "no" stopped feeling like the end of the world.

But here's what happened.

Krispy Kreme made the donuts.

Opportunities showed up. Not despite the bold asks. BECAUSE of them.

And I see this play out in job searches every single week.

The people landing roles the fastest? Not the most qualified candidates in the room.

The ones willing to send the message. Make the ask. Reach out to the "unreachable" contact.

So let me leave you with this:

"If you want a promotion, ask for it. If you want a job, ask for it. If nobody knows what you want, you're never going to get it."

The worst they can say is no.

And you know what? That's actually great practice.

Just ask.

What's ONE ask you've been putting off? Drop it in the comments and let's make it feel a little less scary together.
