**Subject: Your Network Is Working Even When You're Not**

You know what I hear every single week? "I'm not good at networking." And every single week, I watch someone prove themselves wrong.

Here's what I've been noticing from the coaching calls lately: the best networking moments aren't happening on LinkedIn. They're happening at birthday parties, through old colleagues, in conversations people didn't plan for. And that's not an accident. That's how this actually works.

## The Reality About How People Get Hired

One of our clients just made it to round 3 at her dream company. Not through a job board. Not through a cold application. Through a warm connection.

Here's what happened: the hiring manager had worked with someone who used to work with our client. That person put in a good word. After the first meeting, the hiring manager messaged the mutual connection and said, "Wow, she's awesome."

Her rule? She doesn't apply unless she can find a connection somewhere. And honestly, that's a rule worth stealing. If it works, copy it and do more.

Another client just moved to a new city. She was celebrating her birthday at a venue and spotted a marketing specialist posting that was a perfect match for her background. She showed up early, introduced herself to the manager, shared her experience. He was immediately engaged — even asked about salary expectations. That's a buying signal. And she hadn't even planned what to say.

Sometimes it works better that way.

Here's what I want you to do: stop treating networking like a formal event you have to prepare for. Start treating it like something that's already happening around you. Every conversation is a potential connection. Every old colleague is a potential bridge. You don't need a script. You need to show up and be genuinely curious about people.

But when you do talk about yourself — and this matters — don't over-explain. Think of it like Stan Miller's airplane metaphor. Get on the plane: just enough context for someone to care. Get off the runway: the interesting part starts. In the air: you in action, doing the thing. Land safely: clear conclusion. Start closer to the action than you think. Nobody needs your full biography. They need to understand what you do and why it matters, fast.

## From the Coaching Calls

**Q: Why do recruiters ghost me? What did I do wrong?**

We had recruiter Yiorgos Boudouris on a call, and he was refreshingly honest: "If I've ever ghosted someone, it's usually by accident. You've gotten lost in the system. I'm getting close to 2000 leads for one role. You physically fall through the cracks."

So if you haven't heard back, it's almost certainly not personal. You didn't bomb it. You didn't say the wrong thing. You just got buried. Which means following up isn't desperate — it's necessary.

## Quick Win

This week, send one message to someone you haven't talked to in six months. Not "Hey, are you hiring?" Just genuine reconnection. Ask what they're working on. Share something you've been up to. That's it. Plant the seed. You don't need to harvest it today.

Keep showing up.

P.S. That client at the birthday party? She wasn't networking. She was just being herself in a room where opportunity existed. You're probably in rooms like that every week. Pay attention.
