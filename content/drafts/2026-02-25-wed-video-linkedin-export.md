Stop scrolling through LinkedIn trying to find people you already know at your target companies.

Here's what I want you to do. Go to LinkedIn, hit Settings, Data Privacy, Get a Copy of Your Data, select Connections, and export it.

You're gonna get a CSV with every single person you're connected to — their name, company, position, all of it. Open that in Google Sheets.

Now here's where it gets good. Filter by company. Boom — you can instantly see everyone you know at any employer.

Add a checkbox column, mark the people you want to reach out to, and now you've got a targeted outreach list in five minutes.

This is low-hanging fruit, folks. You'd be surprised how many warm connections you're sitting on right now.
