# The One Question to Ask About International Benefits

*Format: LinkedIn text post | Week of 2026-02-23 | Thursday — Q&A Day*

---

Ever read a job posting and notice the benefits don't quite match your situation?

This comes up more than you'd think — especially for international roles.

Here's the scenario: You find a great opportunity. The company is US-based. But the role is in Canada (or another country). And the job description lists 401k matching, US health plans, all that good stuff.

So... what does that actually mean for you?

Here's the move: Ask directly.

Don't dance around it. Don't wait until the offer stage to figure it out. Try something like:

"I noticed the job description discusses US benefits like 401k matching, but since this role is based in Canada — what are the equivalent benefits from the Canadian perspective?"

That's it. Clean. Professional. Specific.

And here's what that question actually signals to the employer:

— You read the job description carefully
— You understand cross-border compensation isn't one-size-fits-all
— You're thinking strategically about the full package, not just salary

This isn't being "difficult." This is being thorough. And good employers respect thoroughness.

Too many job seekers wait until they have an offer in hand to ask about benefits — and then feel blindsided when the package looks different than expected. Let's not be in that camp.

Your micro-action for today: If you're applying to any role where the company HQ is in a different country than your location, flag the benefits section right now. Draft that question. Have it ready before your first conversation.

You deserve clarity before you say yes.
