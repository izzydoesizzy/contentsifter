# Should You Message Recruiters Directly? (A Recruiter Answers)

I asked a recruiter friend a question I get all the time:

"Is it annoying when candidates reach out directly on LinkedIn?"

His answer surprised no one who's been in sales:

"It's one of the MOST effective ways to move to the next part of the process."

But here's the thing — there's a right way and a wrong way.

The wrong way: "Hey, I'd love to work at your company!"

That puts all the work on the recruiter. They're thinking: What role? What's your background? Why should I care?

The right way: Lead with specifics.

→ This is what I'm good at
→ This is the role I'm looking at
→ This is why I'm a fit

You're making it easy for them to say yes.

And here's his cheeky but brilliant advice:

"If you're going to reach out to me on LinkedIn, you better have a profile that excites me. Because that's exactly what you're prompting me to look at."

The reality is — recruiters WANT to find great candidates. That's literally their job. But they're busy. So do the heavy lifting for them.

One more thing: still apply through the job board. The direct message is your fast lane, but the application is your safety net. Do both.

Your micro-action for today: Find one recruiter at a company you're targeting. Before you message them, look at your own profile through their eyes. Does it tell a clear story? If not, fix that first.

Then reach out. Be specific. Be brief. Be memorable.

Does that make sense?
