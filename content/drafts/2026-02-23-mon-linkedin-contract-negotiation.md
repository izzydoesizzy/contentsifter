# From $90K to $260K: The Contract Math Nobody Does

*Format: LinkedIn text post | Week of 2026-02-23 | Monday — Story Day*

Last week, a client called me in a panic.

"They just changed the offer from full-time to contract. Same rate. What do I do?"

Here's what most people do in that moment: they accept it. They're so relieved to have an offer that they don't stop to do the math.

We stopped to do the math.

Because here's what nobody tells you about contract roles — they require completely different compensation math than salaried positions. When you're a contractor, you're covering:

→ Your own health insurance
→ Your own retirement contributions
→ Self-employment taxes
→ Zero paid vacation or sick days
→ The built-in risk of contract work ending

So we sat down and calculated what the role was actually worth as a contract rate. Not what "felt reasonable." What the numbers actually said.

The original offer? Based on a $90K salary expectation.

The negotiated contract rate? Equivalent to $260K annually.

That's not a typo. That's what happens when you stop treating a contract offer like a salaried offer with a different label.

The biggest salary jump I've ever seen with a client — and it happened because we refused to skip the math.

If you're looking at a contract role right now, here's your micro-action for today:

Open a spreadsheet. Add up what your benefits, taxes, vacation, and risk premium actually cost. Then add that number to the base salary before you even think about saying yes.

The offer isn't the offer until you've done the math.
