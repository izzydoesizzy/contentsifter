**Slide 1:** Open Source Is Your Secret Career Weapon

**Slide 2:** Still listing "side projects" on your resume and wondering why nobody cares?

**Slide 3:** Here's the shift: Side projects show effort. Open source contributions show *impact*.

**Slide 4:** You don't need to build a whole library. Bug fixes, docs, and small PRs to well-known projects all count.

**Slide 5:** Make it quantifiable. "Contributed to 5 open source libraries with combined 12,000+ downloads" hits different.

**Slide 6:** Your GitHub should tell a story. Hiring managers *will* look it up. Let's make sure they like what they find.

**Slide 7:** Name the thing. "Developing a data visualization library implementing Grammar of Graphics in Clojure" beats "built some tools" every single time.

**Slide 8:** This works because it signals three things at once: real expertise, community investment, and follow-through.

**Slide 9:** Your action checklist: Pick one project you admire. Make one contribution this week. Update your resume with specifics.

**Slide 10:** Save this for your next resume refresh. Share it with a friend who's underselling their work.
