**Slide 1:** Stop Walking Into Networking Events Cold. There's a system that makes every event 10x more valuable.

**Slide 2:** Do you show up to events, grab a name tag, and hope for the best? Most people do. That's why most people leave empty-handed.

**Slide 3:** Step 1: Curate Your Events. Find 5-10 relevant events. Pick 1-3 worth your time. Not every event deserves a "yes."

**Slide 4:** Step 2: Volunteer. Ask if you can help out. Volunteers get VIP access and a direct line to the organizer — who knows everyone. "It's like networking hyperdrive."

**Slide 5:** Step 3: Research Every Speaker. Read their LinkedIn. Read their bio. Prepare 2-3 specific questions for each. Generic questions get generic conversations.

**Slide 6:** Step 4: Research the Sponsors. Why are they there? What are they selling? What problems do they solve? This is intel most attendees ignore.

**Slide 7:** Step 5: Know Who You Want to Meet. Pick specific people. Know why you want to connect. "I'd love to chat" hits different when you have a reason.

**Slide 8:** Step 6: Reach Out Before the Event. Message a speaker beforehand. Reference their work. Say you'll be there. Now you're not a stranger — you're expected.

**Slide 9:** Your Pre-Event Checklist: Curate 1-3 events. Volunteer if possible. Research speakers + sponsors. Target specific connections. Reach out early.

**Slide 10:** Networking isn't luck. It's preparation. Try this system at your next event and tell me what happens. Follow me for more job search strategies that actually work.
