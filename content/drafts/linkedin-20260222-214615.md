**Stop networking for jobs.**

I know — hear me out.

Here's what I see ALL THE TIME: Job seekers walk into networking events like they're carrying a neon sign that says "HIRE ME PLEASE."

And everyone runs.

But flip the script? Magic happens.

**Here's the thing:**

When you lead with "I'm looking for opportunities" → walls go up instantly.

When you lead with "I've been following this trend in [industry]... what are you seeing?" → they light up and start talking.

**The paradox?**

People who network for INSIGHTS get way more job opportunities than people who network for jobs.

Because they become someone others actually WANT to help.

Let's bust through the typical networking mistakes:

❌ "Help me find a job?"
✅ "What trends are you seeing in [industry]?"

❌ "I'm between roles"  
✅ "I'm exploring the [specific domain] space"

❌ Name-rank-serial-number intros
✅ Value statements: "I help [who] do [what]"

**Think of networking like farming.**

You're planting seeds. Watering relationships. But those seeds only grow if people know EXACTLY what you're looking for.

Vague networking ("I'm open to opportunities") = vague results.

Specific networking ("I'm targeting data analyst roles at mid-size tech companies") = boom. People know how to help you.

**My client Arjun cracked this code.**

He stopped asking for jobs and started inviting people to be guests on his podcast instead.

Suddenly executives who'd been ignoring his cold emails were saying "fuck yes" to 60-minute conversations.

Same person. Same background. Different approach.

Game changer.

**Try this at your next networking event:**

Lead with curiosity about THEIR world, not requests about YOUR situation.

You'd be surprised how fast people want to help someone who's genuinely interested in what they do.
