**Subject: Your Resume Bullets Are Boring. Let's Fix That.**

Hey friend,

I had a conversation this week that stopped me in my tracks. A client showed me her resume — smart, accomplished, ten years of experience — and every single bullet point read like a job description. "Managed cross-functional teams." "Authored public-facing articles." "Organized weekly developer demos."

I looked at her and said, "This tells me what you did. It doesn't tell me why anyone should care."

And that's the problem with 90% of the resumes I see.

## The Formula That Changes Everything

Here's what I want you to do. For every achievement on your resume, I want you to run it through what I call the **XYZ Formula**:

**Achieved [X], as measured by [Y], by doing [Z].**

That's it. Result, metric, method. Every single bullet.

Let me show you what this looks like in practice:

**Before:** "Authored public-facing articles"
**After:** "Achieved 100,000 page views by authoring 12 articles per month for customer acquisition"

**Before:** "Organized weekly developer demos"
**After:** "Saved $6,000 per day ($180,000/month) by creating weekly developer demos that reduced support escalations"

See the difference? The first versions are tasks. The second versions are *proof that you're good at your job.*

The reality is — hiring managers are skimming your resume in about seven seconds. A task list doesn't stop the scroll. A number does. A dollar sign does. A percentage does.

So here's your rule going forward: **every bullet without a metric either gets one, or gets cut.**

"But Izzy, I don't have exact numbers." I hear you. Estimate. Use ranges. Say "approximately." Were you managing a budget? That's a number. Did your work affect a team? How many people? Did something improve? By roughly how much? You have more metrics than you think — you just haven't been trained to see them.

Go through your resume tonight. Pick your three weakest bullets and XYZ them. You'll be shocked at how different your resume reads by tomorrow morning.

## From the Coaching Calls

**Q: I followed up with a recruiter twice and heard nothing. Should I assume it's a no?**

We actually had a recruiter on one of our calls address this directly. His answer surprised people: "If I've ever ghosted someone, it's usually by accident. You've gotten lost in the system. I'm dealing with close to 2,000 leads for a single role. You physically fall through the cracks."

So no — silence doesn't mean rejection. It usually means you got buried. Follow up again. Be polite, be brief, and reference something specific from your last conversation. You're not being annoying. You're being professional.

## Quick Win

Open your resume right now. Find one bullet that's just a task — no numbers, no outcome, no impact. Rewrite it using the XYZ Formula before you close your laptop tonight. Just one. That's how momentum starts.

Keep showing up,
Izzy

P.S. — One of our members told me he used to feel embarrassed just asking people about jobs. Networking felt like begging. Then he reframed it: he wasn't *asking for something* — he was *sharing his value and seeing if there's a fit.* That single shift? He's now meeting heads of product, directors, and alumni he never would have reached before. The fear of rejection is the biggest thing standing between you and the opportunities you want. Ask for the thing you want. If nobody knows what you're looking for, you're never going to get it.
