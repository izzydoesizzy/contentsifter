## Monday (Feb 23) — Story Day

**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Format:** linkedin

**Source:** Most High-Stakes Career Decisions Happen in Rooms You're Not In
**From:** ClearCareer - Career Storytelling Workshop w/ Stan Miller (2024-11-07)
**Speaker:** Stan Miller
**Tags:** #networking, #mindset, #coaching_technique

### Source Material

> Stan Miller's core insight: 'Most promotions, most jobs, most big high-stakes moments in our lives — the decisions for those things are made inside rooms you're not in. But your story can be in that room.'

When someone advocates for you in a hiring meeting, a promotion discussion, or a referral conversation, they're telling your story. That story is built from the narratives and beliefs they've formed about you through your interactions with them.

The implication: the stories you tell people in networking, interviews, and casual conversations shape what others say about you when you're not there. Intentional storytelling is how you influence decisions you'll never witness.

## Tuesday (Feb 24) — Playbook Day

**Source:** Create a Bidding War: Expedite Slower Offers When You Have One in Hand
**From:** ClearCareer Group Call (2024-03-19)
**Speaker:** None
**Tags:** #salary_negotiation, #job_search, #offer_stage

### Source Material

> When you receive an offer or think one is imminent, immediately contact other companies where you're still in process. Tell them you're expecting an offer and ask if they can expedite their timeline. This does two things: (1) Creates urgency — they may accelerate to avoid losing you. (2) Creates competition — when a company knows others want you, loss aversion kicks in and they work harder to win you. Ideal outcome: multiple offers arriving at the same time, giving you maximum negotiating power.
>
> *Direct quote:* "When you're at the stage where you're about to get an offer, you think you're going to get an offer — try to expedite the process for the other positions and say I'm expecting an offer and reach back out just to see if you can get multiple things that stack up at the same time, which gives you a lot more confidence and kind of power over the outcome. It also makes you more desirable — 'oh, these other people are about to hire him, we're going to lose this candidate.'"

## Wednesday (Feb 25) — Video Day

**Platform:** TikTok/Reels/Shorts
**Format:** video-script

**Source:** How to Write a Strong Customer Service Achievement Bullet (Real Example)
**From:** ClearCareer - Coaching Call | Sparsh Kalia and Izzy Piyale-Sheard (2024-03-13)
**Speaker:** None
**Tags:** #resume, #achievement_writing, #customer_service

### Source Material

> Start with an action verb tied to the outcome, include a specific metric, then describe the method. Example structure: '[Result achieved] [metric] by [specific action you took] using [tools/methods].' Real example from coaching: 'Resolved 95% of client billing balances and disputes within 24 hours by implementing a systematic follow-up process using Epic, Guideware, and SharePoint to access client data and monitor payments.' This is 3x more powerful than 'Handled customer inquiries professionally.'

> *Direct quote:* "Resolved 95% of client balances and disputes within 24 hours by implementing a systematic follow-up process. Received accolades from my manager for achieving nearly 100% customer satisfaction by maintaining a respectful and professional demeanor even through challenging, frustrated customer interactions."

## Thursday (Feb 26) — Q&A Day

**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Format:** linkedin

**Source:** Q: Why Do Custom LinkedIn Messages Matter? (Recruiter's View)
**From:** ClearCareer - Ask a Recruiter w/ Rup Jolly (2024-11-20)
**Speaker:** Rup Jolly
**Tags:** #networking, #linkedin, #job_search

### Source Material

> Q: Does personalizing LinkedIn messages to recruiters actually matter?

A (from recruiter Rup Jolly): Yes, enormously. Rup reports that about 90% of LinkedIn messages he receives for roles he's posted are generic LinkedIn templates. They all look the same — he ignores almost all of them.

A custom message:
- References the specific role or company initiative
- Shows you've actually read the job posting
- Demonstrates genuine interest vs mass-applying
- Gets his attention in under 5 seconds

Suggested format: '1-2 sentences on why THIS role at THIS company interests you + 1 sentence on your most relevant qualification or result.' That's all. The goal is to get them to click your profile, not to tell your whole story.
>
> *Direct quote:* "I get a lot of messages on LinkedIn every day for roles I posted. I would say about 90% of them, I get generic template. So it's a LinkedIn template message every day, 90% of them. You're not going to stand out doing that. So write a custom message."

## Friday (Feb 27) — Testimonial Day

**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Format:** linkedin

**Source:** Arjun Testimonial: From Embarrassed to Ask About Jobs to Confidently Networking
**From:** ClearCareer - Coaching Call | Arjun Chowdhury and Izzy Piyale-Sheard (2024-07-16)
**Speaker:** Arjun Chowdhury
**Tags:** #networking, #mindset, #job_search, #testimonial

### Source Material

> Arjun Chowdhury's before/after transformation through ClearCareer coaching:

BEFORE: 'I felt really embarrassed to ask for a job or that I'm looking to people. I just wanted to have a conversation from an insights perspective.' Networking felt shameful. He avoided mentioning he was job searching.

AFTER: 'You taught me how to sort of give those value adds to employers — what are the problems that you can solve, what is the value add. That was an aha moment from me.' He was now meeting head of product, product directors, and Kellogg alumni — people he never would have reached before.

Key lesson: The embarrassment of asking for a job disappears when you reframe from 'asking for something' to 'sharing your value and asking if there's a fit.' That's a coaching intervention that changes lives.

## Saturday (Feb 28) — Newsletter Day

**Platform:** Email
**Format:** email-weekly

**Source:** 3-Part LinkedIn Headline Formula (From a Recruiter's View)
**From:** ClearCareer - Ask a Recruiter w/ Rup Jolly (2024-11-20)
**Speaker:** Rup Jolly
**Tags:** #linkedin, #job_search

### Source Material

> Rup Jolly: 90% of LinkedIn profiles have an under-optimized headline. Here's the 3-part formula that works:

**Part 1: Your job title or target role**
'Looking for Back-End Software Engineer' or 'Product Manager | Open to Work'

**Part 2: Specific hard skills**
List the primary technical or domain skills that define you:
'Java 17+ | Spring Boot | Microservices' or 'B2B SaaS | Platform Products | Growth'

**Part 3: Value proposition**
A brief statement of your scale or impact:
'Built multiple data-intensive applications at scale' or 'Helped 3 startups reach Series A'

**Why it works for recruiters**: When Rup is in LinkedIn Recruiter viewing 25 profiles at a glance, the headline is one of the first things he scans. A clear, specific headline immediately tells him if you're worth clicking.

**Additional LinkedIn tip**: Add specific skills to each role in your experience section — recruiters can search for these in LinkedIn Recruiter. Use top 5-6 most relevant skills per role; don't keyword-stuff with 20+ skills, as it signals low credibility.
>
> *Direct quote:* "I'm going to talk about headlines because that's one of the big things nobody really does properly. I would say 90% of the profiles I look at, they don't have a great headline. Don't settle just for your job title. So it's three parts. The first part is have your job title or like what you're looking for. Then you could have like a line specific hard skills. And then an important value prop. In one sentence, I immediately understand who you are, what you're all about."

**From:** ClearCareer - Weekly Group Q&A Call (2025-01-21)
**Speaker:** Izzy Piyale-Sheard
**Tags:** #mindset, #job_search, #resume, #career_pivot

### Source Material

> **Q:** My career path looks like job hopping — different industries, pivots, short stints. How do I get hiring managers to see this as an asset rather than a red flag?

**A:** First, stop seeing yourself as tainted. You can't reverse time and a winding career path isn't automatically disqualifying.

Here's the reframe:
1. **Find the common thread** — even if industries differ, your skills, values, and approach are consistent. Name that thread explicitly: 'I've built successful teams across three industries — what's consistent is how I approach the work.'
2. **Lead with value, not apology** — your breadth of experience is a genuine differentiator. Diverse industry exposure = adaptability, cross-functional perspective, broader pattern recognition.
3. **Target companies that value versatility** — some cultures prize deep specialization; others prize adaptable generalists. Your job is to find companies that need what you offer.
4. **Connect with people who've had similar paths** — they've navigated the same objections and can share what framing worked.

The goal isn't to justify your history. It's to make the value of your history undeniable.
>
> *Direct quote:* "At the end of the day, it is what it is. You can't go back and reverse time and it's not necessarily a terrible thing. So don't like see yourself in this light that's like this tainted, nobody's going to hire me thing. It's more really just about the value that you're going to bring."

### Source Material

> Tamara shared a moment of breakthrough: she felt she wasn't capable of a role, wasn't able to do it — then started doing it and realized she could not only do it, but excel. This is the arc of most job search breakthroughs: the fear of not being enough is disproven by doing. The job that feels out of reach, the email to the hiring manager that feels too bold, the interview for the role you're not fully qualified for — these are the things that actually work, precisely because they require courage that most candidates don't show.

**Source:** Joel Clears 2-Hour Technical Interview in 1 Hour by Narrating His Process
**From:** ClearCareer Group Call (2024-03-26)
**Speaker:** Izzy Piyale-Sheard
**Tags:** #interviews, #mindset, #job_search

### Source Material

> Joel had a 2-hour technical interview scheduled. He cleared it in 1 hour. His strategy: narrate everything out loud. Instead of silently working, he talked through his thinking as he went — explaining why he was making each decision, what he was considering, what he was about to try. This turned a pass/fail code test into a demonstration of senior engineering judgment. The interviewers were so impressed they cut it short because they had seen enough. Vocal = confident = senior.
