### Source Material

> One of Izzy's clients was offered what was originally pitched as a full-time permanent role at a US company — then the company changed it to a contract position at the last minute.
>
> Rather than accepting whatever rate they proposed, the client worked with Izzy to calculate and negotiate a proper contract rate that reflected the true value of the work.
>
> The outcome: the client went from a $90,000 annual salary expectation to a contract rate equivalent to $260,000 — the biggest salary jump Izzy had personally witnessed with a client.
>
> *Direct quote:* "She was making about 90K in the States in their past job and got a job offer... the end result, you're not going to believe this, is she ended up with a rate equivalent to $260,000, which is the biggest shift that I've had personally with a client."

### Draft

Last week, a client called me in a panic.

"They just changed the offer from full-time to contract. Same rate. What do I do?"

Here's what most people do in that moment: they accept it. They're so relieved to have an offer that they don't stop to do the math.

We stopped to do the math.

Because here's what nobody tells you about contract roles — they require completely different compensation math than salaried positions. When you're a contractor, you're covering:

→ Your own health insurance
→ Your own retirement contributions
→ Self-employment taxes
→ Zero paid vacation or sick days
→ The built-in risk of contract work ending

So we sat down and calculated what the role was actually worth as a contract rate. Not what "felt reasonable." What the numbers actually said.

The original offer? Based on a $90K salary expectation.

The negotiated contract rate? Equivalent to $260K annually.

That's not a typo. That's what happens when you stop treating a contract offer like a salaried offer with a different label.

The biggest salary jump I've ever seen with a client — and it happened because we refused to skip the math.

If you're looking at a contract role right now, here's your micro-action for today:

Open a spreadsheet. Add up what your benefits, taxes, vacation, and risk premium actually cost. Then add that number to the base salary before you even think about saying yes.

The offer isn't the offer until you've done the math.

### Source Material

> Building or contributing to open source libraries is one of the most powerful career signals in technical fields. Instead of 'I build side projects,' you can say: 'Developing a data visualization library implementing Grammar of Graphics in Clojure; contributed to 5 open source libraries with combined 12,000+ downloads.' This is quantifiable, demonstrates real expertise, shows community investment, and gives hiring managers something to look up.
>
> *Direct quote:* "implementing a grammar of graphics in Clojure... contributors to how many different libraries... five-ish... 12,000 or 13,000 downloads."

### Draft

**Slide 1:** Open Source Is Your Secret Career Weapon

**Slide 2:** Still listing "side projects" on your resume and wondering why nobody cares?

**Slide 3:** Here's the shift: Side projects show effort. Open source contributions show *impact*.

**Slide 4:** You don't need to build a whole library. Bug fixes, docs, and small PRs to well-known projects all count.

**Slide 5:** Make it quantifiable. "Contributed to 5 open source libraries with combined 12,000+ downloads" hits different.

**Slide 6:** Your GitHub should tell a story. Hiring managers *will* look it up. Let's make sure they like what they find.

**Slide 7:** Name the thing. "Developing a data visualization library implementing Grammar of Graphics in Clojure" beats "built some tools" every single time.

**Slide 8:** This works because it signals three things at once: real expertise, community investment, and follow-through.

**Slide 9:** Your action checklist: Pick one project you admire. Make one contribution this week. Update your resume with specifics.

**Slide 10:** Save this for your next resume refresh. Share it with a friend who's underselling their work.

Here's what I want you to do. Go to LinkedIn, hit Settings, Data Privacy, Get a Copy of Your Data, select Connections, and export it.

[VISUAL: Settings → Data Privacy → Get a copy of your data]

You're gonna get a CSV with every single person you're connected to — their name, company, position, all of it. Open that in Google Sheets.

Now here's where it gets good. Filter by company. Boom — you can instantly see everyone you know at any employer.

[VISUAL: Filter by Company → instant warm leads]

Add a checkbox column, mark the people you want to reach out to, and now you've got a targeted outreach list in five minutes.

This is low-hanging fruit, folks. You'd be surprised how many warm connections you're sitting on right now.

**Source:** How to Ask About International Benefits and Compensation
**From:** ClearCareer - Coaching Call | Victor Perez and Izzy Piyale-Sheard (2024-03-01)
**Speaker:** Victor Perez
**Tags:** #interviews, #company_research, #salary_negotiation

### Source Material

> Q: How should I address benefits differences when a job posting shows US benefits but the role is in another country?
>
> A: When you notice a job description lists US-specific benefits (like 401k matching) but the role is in Canada or another country, directly ask: 'I noticed the job description discusses US benefits like 401k matching, but since this role is based in [country], what are the equivalent benefits from the [country] perspective?'
>
> *Direct quote:* "I said, okay, because your job description talks about benefits for an American company. I want to know, am I going to be paid from the United States or from Canada?"

### Draft

Ever read a job posting and notice the benefits don't quite match your situation?

This comes up more than you'd think — especially for international roles.

Here's the scenario: You find a great opportunity. The company is US-based. But the role is in Canada (or another country). And the job description lists 401k matching, US health plans, all that good stuff.

So... what does that actually mean for you?

Here's the move: Ask directly.

Don't dance around it. Don't wait until the offer stage to figure it out. Try something like:

"I noticed the job description discusses US benefits like 401k matching, but since this role is based in Canada — what are the equivalent benefits from the Canadian perspective?"

That's it. Clean. Professional. Specific.

And here's what that question actually signals to the employer:

— You read the job description carefully
— You understand cross-border compensation isn't one-size-fits-all
— You're thinking strategically about the full package, not just salary

This isn't being "difficult." This is being thorough. And good employers respect thoroughness.

Too many job seekers wait until they have an offer in hand to ask about benefits — and then feel blindsided when the package looks different than expected. Let's not be in that camp.

Your micro-action for today: If you're applying to any role where the company HQ is in a different country than your location, flag the benefits section right now. Draft that question. Have it ready before your first conversation.

You deserve clarity before you say yes.

## Friday (Feb 27) — Testimonial Day

**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Format:** linkedin

**Source:** Sparsh Confirms: Apply on Company Website 5-7 Days Before Indeed
**From:** ClearCareer Group Call (2024-04-23)
**Speaker:** Sparsh
**Tags:** #job_search, #testimonial

### Source Material

> Sparsh validated the tip to apply directly on company websites rather than waiting for jobs to appear on Indeed or LinkedIn: 'At least 6 of the roles I applied for on the company website, a week later or five days later, it pops up on Indeed saying that hey, this person is hiring — and I already applied.'
>
> *Direct quote:* "At least I would say six of the roles I applied on the company website, and a week later or like five days later, it pops up on Indeed saying that hey, this person is hiring and I'm like, I already applied, so I think the early bird applicant something privilege."

### Draft

Here's the thing about job searching that most people get wrong:

They wait for the job to come to them.

They scroll Indeed. They scroll LinkedIn. They hit "Easy Apply" and hope for the best.

But by the time a role hits the big job boards, hundreds — sometimes thousands — of people are already applying.

You're not late. But you're not early either.

One of the folks in our program tested something I've been coaching for a while: go directly to company websites and apply there FIRST.

What they found blew them away.

At least 6 of the roles they applied for on company career pages showed up on Indeed 5-7 days LATER. By the time the flood of applicants hit, their application was already in the system. Already being reviewed. Already ahead.

That's not a hack. That's just how hiring works.

Most companies post on their own careers page first. Then it trickles out to the aggregators. That 5-7 day window? That's your competitive advantage.

Here's what I want you to do this week:

1. Pick 5 companies you're genuinely interested in
2. Go to their careers page directly
3. Set up job alerts on THEIR site
4. Apply before the rest of the world even knows the role exists

You'd be surprised how much of job searching comes down to timing and intentionality — not just qualifications.

Stop waiting for the algorithm to serve you opportunities. Go find them at the source.

Keep showing up. But show up early.

**Subject: Your Resume Bullets Are Boring. Let's Fix That.**

Hey friend,

I had a conversation this week that stopped me in my tracks. A client showed me her resume — smart, accomplished, ten years of experience — and every single bullet point read like a job description. "Managed cross-functional teams." "Authored public-facing articles." "Organized weekly developer demos."

I looked at her and said, "This tells me what you did. It doesn't tell me why anyone should care."

And that's the problem with 90% of the resumes I see.

## The Formula That Changes Everything

Here's what I want you to do. For every achievement on your resume, I want you to run it through what I call the **XYZ Formula**:

**Achieved [X], as measured by [Y], by doing [Z].**

That's it. Result, metric, method. Every single bullet.

Let me show you what this looks like in practice:

**Before:** "Authored public-facing articles"
**After:** "Achieved 100,000 page views by authoring 12 articles per month for customer acquisition"

**Before:** "Organized weekly developer demos"
**After:** "Saved $6,000 per day ($180,000/month) by creating weekly developer demos that reduced support escalations"

See the difference? The first versions are tasks. The second versions are *proof that you're good at your job.*

The reality is — hiring managers are skimming your resume in about seven seconds. A task list doesn't stop the scroll. A number does. A dollar sign does. A percentage does.

So here's your rule going forward: **every bullet without a metric either gets one, or gets cut.**

"But Izzy, I don't have exact numbers." I hear you. Estimate. Use ranges. Say "approximately." Were you managing a budget? That's a number. Did your work affect a team? How many people? Did something improve? By roughly how much? You have more metrics than you think — you just haven't been trained to see them.

Go through your resume tonight. Pick your three weakest bullets and XYZ them. You'll be shocked at how different your resume reads by tomorrow morning.

## From the Coaching Calls

**Q: I followed up with a recruiter twice and heard nothing. Should I assume it's a no?**

We actually had a recruiter on one of our calls address this directly. His answer surprised people: "If I've ever ghosted someone, it's usually by accident. You've gotten lost in the system. I'm dealing with close to 2,000 leads for a single role. You physically fall through the cracks."

So no — silence doesn't mean rejection. It usually means you got buried. Follow up again. Be polite, be brief, and reference something specific from your last conversation. You're not being annoying. You're being professional.

## Quick Win

Open your resume right now. Find one bullet that's just a task — no numbers, no outcome, no impact. Rewrite it using the XYZ Formula before you close your laptop tonight. Just one. That's how momentum starts.

Keep showing up,
Izzy

P.S. — One of our members told me he used to feel embarrassed just asking people about jobs. Networking felt like begging. Then he reframed it: he wasn't *asking for something* — he was *sharing his value and seeing if there's a fit.* That single shift? He's now meeting heads of product, directors, and alumni he never would have reached before. The fear of rejection is the biggest thing standing between you and the opportunities you want. Ask for the thing you want. If nobody knows what you're looking for, you're never going to get it.
