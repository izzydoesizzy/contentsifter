## WEEK 1

---

### Monday, Feb 24 — Story Post (Networking)

**Pillar:** Story | **Source:** #212, #116 (Close the Loop + Rooms You're Not In)

---

I had a client last year who got rejected from a role she REALLY wanted.

She did something most people don't do.

She sent a thank-you email to the hiring manager. Not a generic "thanks for your time" email. A real one. She mentioned specific things they discussed, thanked them for the insight, and said she'd love to stay connected.

Three weeks later, that same hiring manager forwarded her resume to a colleague at a different company.

She got the job.

Here's the thing most people miss about networking:

The biggest career decisions happen in rooms you're not in.

Your story can be in that room. But only if people remember you. And people remember you when you close the loop.

→ Got rejected? Send the thank-you email anyway.
→ Got advice? Go back and tell them you used it.
→ Met someone at an event? Follow up within 48 hours.

You're not just building a network. You're planting seeds in rooms you'll never see.

Keep showing up. 💪

### Tuesday, Feb 25 — Playbook Post (Resume)

**Pillar:** Playbook | **Source:** #35, #262 (Resume as Checklist + F-Pattern Reading)

---

Stop writing your resume like a biography.

I see this ALL the time. People writing paragraph after paragraph about their career history. What they did. Where they worked. Blah blah blah.

Here's what hiring managers actually do:

They scan your resume in an F-pattern. Top to bottom, left to right. 6 seconds. That's it.

So let's flip the script.

Treat the job posting like a checklist:

✅ Years of experience? Check.
✅ Specific tools they mentioned? Check.
✅ Industry background? Check.
✅ Leadership experience? Check.

Then make sure every single one of those checkboxes is visible in the TOP THIRD of your resume.

Not buried on page 2. Not hidden in a paragraph. Right there. Up front. Where the F-pattern hits.

Your resume isn't your life story. It's an ad. And you've got 6 seconds to make the sale.

One thing you can do today: pull up your resume and the last job posting you applied to. Count how many of their requirements appear in your first 5 bullet points.

If the answer is less than 3, we've got work to do.

### Wednesday, Feb 26 — 🎬 VIDEO SCRIPT (Interviews)

**Pillar:** Video | **Source:** #88 (Joel Clears Technical Interview)

---

[HOOK - text overlay: "He finished a 2-hour interview in 1 hour"]

My client Joel had a 2-hour technical interview coming up. He was stressed.

I told him one thing: narrate everything out loud.

[VISUAL: "Talk through your thinking"]

Don't sit there in silence working through the problem. Talk. Tell them WHY you're making each decision. What you're considering. What you're about to try.

[VISUAL: "What happened?"]

He finished the whole thing in one hour. The interviewers told him it was one of the best technical interviews they'd ever seen.

Not because he was the smartest person in the room. Because they could SEE how he thinks.

[VISUAL: "Your process IS the answer"]

Next time you're in a technical interview, remember: they're not just testing what you know. They're testing how you think.

Show them.

Save this if you've got a technical interview coming up. 🔥

### Thursday, Feb 27 — Q&A Post (Interviews)

**Pillar:** Q&A | **Source:** #47 (How to Answer Questions About Experience You Don't Have)

---

"What's your experience with [thing I've never done]?"

This question makes people freeze. I get it.

Here's exactly what to say:

"I don't have direct experience with X, but I DO have experience with Y, which is similar because..."

Then you tell them:
→ The challenges you faced
→ The results you got
→ What you learned that transfers directly

That's it. No apologizing. No spiraling. No "I'm sorry, I don't have that."

You redirect.

I coached someone last month who got asked about a specific software platform she'd never touched. She said: "I haven't used that exact tool, but I spent 3 years on a similar platform, and in that time I automated a reporting process that saved my team 10 hours a week."

She got the offer.

Nobody has 100% of the qualifications. NOBODY. Not even the person who wrote the job posting.

Your job isn't to have every answer. It's to show them how you think, how you learn, and what you bring.

Try this: right now, think of one skill you DON'T have that keeps showing up in job postings. Then write down your closest experience. That's how you redirect.

### Friday, Feb 28 — Testimonial/Social Proof Post

**Pillar:** Testimonial | **Source:** #189 (Sparsh Post-Rejection Email)

---

"I legit sent your thank-you email and they offered me the job."

That's a real message from a real member of our community.

Here's what happened:

My client applied to a role at a company he liked. They rejected him. They had a "more qualified candidate."

Most people stop here. Delete the email. Move on. Feel crappy.

He sent the post-rejection thank-you email template I share with everyone. A simple, gracious note keeping the door open.

They called him back and offered him the job.

Let me say that again: **the company that rejected him called him back.**

Why? Because most people disappear after rejection. My client stayed with it. And it made him memorable.

This is why I tell every single person I work with: your job search doesn't end at rejection. Sometimes it starts there.

Do you have a rejection sitting in your inbox right now? Send that thank-you email. Today. You'd be surprised what happens.

### Saturday, Mar 1 — Story Post (Salary/Negotiation)

**Pillar:** Story | **Source:** #253 (Client $90K to $260K)

---

My client was making $90K.

She got offered a new role. Exciting, right?

Then the company changed the offer from full-time to contract. At the last minute.

Most people would've taken whatever rate they proposed. She was already excited about the role. She didn't want to lose it.

Instead, she called me.

We sat down and calculated what her full-time equivalent rate needed to be as a contractor. We factored in benefits she'd lose. Self-employment tax. Insurance. Retirement contributions.

Then she negotiated.

The result? A rate equivalent to **$260,000 per year.**

From $90K to $260K.

Not because she's some negotiation genius. Because she did the math, knew her number, and asked for it.

Three things made this work:

1️⃣ She didn't react emotionally to the contract switch
2️⃣ She calculated the REAL number (not just "add 20%")
3️⃣ She communicated her value clearly and confidently

If someone offers you a contract role, don't just compare the hourly rate to your old salary. Do the math. Factor in EVERYTHING you're giving up.

Then ask for what you're worth.

## WEEK 2

---

### Monday, Mar 3 — Story Post (Mindset)

**Pillar:** Story | **Source:** #55, #130 (Fear of Best-Case Scenario + Imposter Syndrome)

---

I want to talk about something nobody talks about.

The fear of the BEST-case scenario.

One of my clients was about to post an "open to work" update on LinkedIn. She froze. Not because she was afraid nobody would respond.

Because she was afraid people WOULD respond.

If they responded, she'd have to do interviews. And her last interview experience was brutal. An interviewer (a senior engineer, 15 years older) grilled her on every gap in her knowledge for 45 minutes straight.

So her brain did that thing brains do: it decided the safest option was to not put herself out there at all.

Sound familiar?

Here's what I told her:

That interview was ONE person at ONE company on ONE bad day. It's not a prophecy. It's a data point.

And here's what another client told me after she pushed through the exact same fear:

"You're gonna feel like, oh, I'm not capable, I'm not able to do this. But then when you start doing it, you're like, what, I CAN do this. I can do more. And I can excel."

The fear doesn't go away before you act. It goes away BECAUSE you act.

What's the one thing you've been avoiding because the best-case scenario scares you?

### Tuesday, Mar 4 — Playbook Post (Networking)

**Pillar:** Playbook | **Source:** #132, #240 (Pitch Slapping + Give Before You Ask)

---

Stop pitch-slapping people on LinkedIn.

If you don't know the term: pitch slapping is when you connect with someone and IMMEDIATELY ask them for something. A job. A referral. A "quick 15-minute chat."

You wouldn't walk up to a stranger at a party and say "Hi, can you get me a job?" So why do it on LinkedIn?

Here's what to do instead:

**Give before you ask. Every single time.**

5 ways to give value BEFORE you need something:

1️⃣ **Reference their work.** "I saw your talk at [event] and your point about X changed how I think about Y."

2️⃣ **Share their content.** Repost something they wrote. Add your own take. Tag them.

3️⃣ **Send a relevant article.** "Saw this and thought of our conversation about [topic]."

4️⃣ **Make an introduction.** Connect them with someone THEY would benefit from knowing.

5️⃣ **Close the loop.** If they gave you advice before, tell them you used it and what happened.

The people who get replies on LinkedIn aren't the ones who ask the best questions. They're the ones who give the most value first.

Try this today: pick ONE person you want to connect with. Find something they've posted. Leave a thoughtful comment. That's it. No ask. Just value.

The ask comes later. And when it does, they'll actually want to help.

### Wednesday, Mar 5 — 🎬 VIDEO SCRIPT (LinkedIn)

**Pillar:** Video | **Source:** #37, #221 (LinkedIn Headline as Taxi Ad + 3-Part Formula)

---

[HOOK - text overlay: "Your LinkedIn headline is costing you interviews"]

Quick question. What does your LinkedIn headline say right now?

If it just says your job title, you're leaving opportunities on the table.

Think of your headline like a taxi ad. Every time you comment, like, or connect with someone, they see it. It's driving around LinkedIn all day long.

[VISUAL: "The 3-Part Formula"]

Here's what works:

Part 1: Your target role. What you do or want to do.
Part 2: The tools and skills that make you specific.
Part 3: Who you help or the results you get.

[VISUAL: Before/After example]

❌ "Marketing Manager"

✅ "Marketing Manager | SEO, Content Strategy, HubSpot | Helping B2B SaaS companies grow organic traffic"

See the difference? One tells me your job title. The other tells me exactly what you bring to the table.

Go update yours right now. Takes 2 minutes.

### Thursday, Mar 6 — Q&A Post (Job Search Strategy)

**Pillar:** Q&A | **Source:** #204 (Can I Stop Applying If I Have Interviews?)

---

"I have a few interviews lined up. Can I stop applying?"

I get this question every single week.

And every time, my answer is the same:

**No. Keep going.**

I know it's hard. You're tired. You've been grinding. And it feels like FINALLY you've got some momentum.

But here's the reality:

Interviews fall through. All the time. The role gets frozen. The budget gets cut. They hire internally. The timing shifts.

And if you stopped your pipeline to focus on those interviews?

You're starting from ZERO again.

Let me put it this way:

→ 1 interview in the pipeline = a nice start
→ 3 interviews in the pipeline = real momentum
→ 5+ interviews = you get to CHOOSE

The people who land the best offers aren't the ones who put all their eggs in one basket. They're the ones who kept planting seeds even when it felt redundant.

So yes, prepare for those interviews. Prep hard. Give them everything.

But don't stop networking. Don't stop applying. Don't stop watering the other seeds.

Your future self will thank you.

### Friday, Mar 7 — Testimonial Post (Community Impact)

**Pillar:** Testimonial | **Source:** #152, #78 (Arjun Transformation + Ha-Doan 50 Connection Requests)

---

Before joining my program, one of my members said:

"I felt really embarrassed to ask for a job or that I'm looking."

He avoided telling people he was job searching. Networking felt shameful. He'd have coffee chats but never actually say what he needed.

After coaching, he learned how to reframe it. Instead of "Can you help me find a job?" it became "Here's the value I bring. Here are the problems I can solve. What do you think?"

COMPLETELY different energy.

Another member took a similar approach and went ALL in:

She joined a leadership networking program with 50 mentors. She sent personalized connection requests to EVERY SINGLE ONE.

Almost all accepted. About half replied. Many asked for a one-on-one.

She booked 25+ conversations in one quarter.

From embarrassed to book 25+ conversations.

That's not a personality change. That's a skill. And skills can be learned.

If networking feels crappy right now, that's normal. It felt crappy for everyone at first. The trick isn't waiting until it feels comfortable. The trick is doing it UNTIL it feels comfortable.

What's one networking message you've been avoiding? Send it today. 💪

### Saturday, Mar 8 — Playbook Post (Interviews)

**Pillar:** Playbook | **Source:** #197, #220 (Four Core Story Archetypes + Recruiter's Prep Framework)

---

A recruiter told me something that blew my mind:

"Most candidates spend ZERO hours preparing for interviews."

Zero. They just show up and wing it.

So here's your cheat code: spend 1-2 hours prepping, and you're already ahead of 90% of candidates.

Here's EXACTLY how to use those 2 hours:

**Prepare 4 stories. That's it. Just 4.**

1️⃣ Your biggest success story (specific project, clear result)
2️⃣ Your biggest failure and what you learned
3️⃣ A time you dealt with a difficult person
4️⃣ A passion project or something that lights you up

Why these 4? Because almost every behavioral interview question is a variation of one of them.

"Tell me about a challenge" = Story #2 or #3
"What are you proud of?" = Story #1
"Why this role?" = Story #4

For each story, write it out using the STAR format:
→ **S**ituation (2 sentences max)
→ **T**ask (what was your specific role?)
→ **A**ction (what did YOU do, step by step?)
→ **R**esult (specific numbers if possible)

Then practice saying them out loud. Not reading them. SAYING them.

The people who ace interviews aren't smoother or smarter. They're more prepared.

Two hours. Four stories. That's the whole game.
