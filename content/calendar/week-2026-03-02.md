### Source Material

> Izzy references Jia Jiang's 'Rejection Therapy' TED Talk as a powerful tool for overcoming fear of networking and outreach. Jia challenged himself to get rejected at least once per day for 100 days. His asks were deliberately ridiculous — asking a security guard to borrow $100, asking Krispy Kreme to make Olympic ring-shaped donuts. Some actually got a yes. Krispy Kreme made the donuts.

> *Direct quote:* "Don't be afraid. Ask for help. Ask for the thing that you want. If you want a promotion, ask for it. If you want a job, ask for it. Because ask and you shall receive. If nobody knows the things that you want, you're never going to get it."

### Draft

I watched a TED Talk that changed how I coach job seekers.

Jia Jiang decided to get rejected once a day for 100 days straight. On purpose.

He asked a security guard to borrow $100. He walked into Krispy Kreme and asked them to make donuts shaped like the Olympic rings.

Here's the thing — Krispy Kreme actually made them.

Some of his most ridiculous asks got a yes. But that wasn't even the point. The point was that after weeks of deliberate rejection, the word "no" lost its power over him.

I think about this constantly when I'm working with job seekers.

The reality is, fear of rejection is the #1 reason people don't reach out to hiring managers. It's why they don't message that VP on LinkedIn. It's why they don't ask for the informational interview. It's why they don't follow up after being ghosted.

We treat "no" like it's a verdict on who we are. It's not. It's just a word.

You don't need 100 days of rejection therapy. But you could start small this week. Ask for something you'd normally talk yourself out of. Ask someone for coffee. Ask a stranger for directions. Ask for a discount at a store.

Train your nervous system to handle "no" so it stops running the show.

Because here's what I tell every client: if nobody knows what you want, you're never going to get it.

Ask for help. Ask for the thing you actually want. The worst they can say is no — and now you know that's survivable.

Keep showing up.

## Tuesday (Mar 03) — Playbook Day

**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Format:** carousel

**Source:** Pre-Event Research System: How to Maximize Every Networking Event
**From:** ClearCareer Group Call (2024-03-12)
**Speaker:** Izzy Piyale-Sheard
**Tags:** #networking, #personal_branding, #job_search, #events

### Source Material

> Before any professional event: (1) Find 5-10 relevant events in your field and choose 1-3 worth attending; (2) Check if you can volunteer (gives VIP access and connection to the organizer, who is typically hyper-connected); (3) Research every speaker; (4) Research the sponsors; (5) Plan specifically who you want to connect with and why; (6) Consider reaching out to speakers before the event.
>
> *Direct quote:* "When you volunteer, it's kind of like networking hyperdrive."

### Draft

**Slide 1:** Stop Walking Into Networking Events Cold. There's a system that makes every event 10x more valuable.

**Slide 2:** Do you show up to events, grab a name tag, and hope for the best? Most people do. That's why most people leave empty-handed.

**Slide 3:** Step 1: Curate Your Events. Find 5-10 relevant events. Pick 1-3 worth your time. Not every event deserves a "yes."

**Slide 4:** Step 2: Volunteer. Ask if you can help out. Volunteers get VIP access and a direct line to the organizer — who knows everyone. "It's like networking hyperdrive."

**Slide 5:** Step 3: Research Every Speaker. Read their LinkedIn. Read their bio. Prepare 2-3 specific questions for each. Generic questions get generic conversations.

**Slide 6:** Step 4: Research the Sponsors. Why are they there? What are they selling? What problems do they solve? This is intel most attendees ignore.

**Slide 7:** Step 5: Know Who You Want to Meet. Pick specific people. Know why you want to connect. "I'd love to chat" hits different when you have a reason.

**Slide 8:** Step 6: Reach Out Before the Event. Message a speaker beforehand. Reference their work. Say you'll be there. Now you're not a stranger — you're expected.

**Slide 9:** Your Pre-Event Checklist: Curate 1-3 events. Volunteer if possible. Research speakers + sponsors. Target specific connections. Reach out early.

**Slide 10:** Networking isn't luck. It's preparation. Try this system at your next event and tell me what happens. Follow me for more job search strategies that actually work.

"Stop sending connection requests like you're handing out flyers at a mall."

[VISUAL: Cut to LinkedIn screen, generic "I'd like to add you to my network"]

"Here's what I want you to do instead. Five to seven personalized connection requests. Every. Single. Day."

[VISUAL: Text overlay — "5-7 per day"]

"And I mean personalized. Reference their actual work. Something like — 'Hey Sarah, I saw your data migration project at Shopify, and as someone breaking into tech, I'm genuinely inspired by the path you took. I'd love to connect.'"

[VISUAL: Typing out a real message]

"That's it. That's the whole system. And here's the math — you'd be surprised. Five a day for three months? That's four hundred and fifty warm connections. All with personalized openers. All remembering how you showed up."

[VISUAL: Text overlay — "450+ connections in 90 days"]

"This is the lowest-hanging fruit in your entire job search. Consistency over intensity."

[VISUAL: Izzy pointing at camera]

"Save this. Try it for one week. Then follow for more."

## Thursday (Mar 05) — Q&A Day

**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Format:** linkedin

**Source:** Q: Should I Reach Out to the Recruiter Directly? (Recruiter Answers)
**From:** ClearCareer - Ask a Recruiter w/Yiorgos (2024-09-26)
**Speaker:** Yiorgos Boudouris
**Tags:** #networking, #linkedin, #job_search, #qa

### Source Material

> Q: Is it a good idea to reach out directly to a recruiter on LinkedIn?
>
> A (recruiter Yiorgos): 'Yes — it's one of the most effective ways of moving to the next part of the process. The least effective: Hey Yiorgos, I want to work at Zinsurance. Don't make me do the work. Tell me: this is what I'm good at, this is what I'm looking for. Also: if you're going to touch me on LinkedIn, you better have a LinkedIn profile that excites me.'

### Draft

I asked a recruiter friend a question I get all the time:

"Is it annoying when candidates reach out directly on LinkedIn?"

His answer surprised no one who's been in sales:

"It's one of the MOST effective ways to move to the next part of the process."

But here's the thing — there's a right way and a wrong way.

The wrong way: "Hey, I'd love to work at your company!"

That puts all the work on the recruiter. They're thinking: What role? What's your background? Why should I care?

The right way: Lead with specifics.

→ This is what I'm good at
→ This is the role I'm looking at
→ This is why I'm a fit

You're making it easy for them to say yes.

And here's his cheeky but brilliant advice:

"If you're going to reach out to me on LinkedIn, you better have a profile that excites me. Because that's exactly what you're prompting me to look at."

The reality is — recruiters WANT to find great candidates. That's literally their job. But they're busy. So do the heavy lifting for them.

One more thing: still apply through the job board. The direct message is your fast lane, but the application is your safety net. Do both.

Your micro-action for today: Find one recruiter at a company you're targeting. Before you message them, look at your own profile through their eyes. Does it tell a clear story? If not, fix that first.

Then reach out. Be specific. Be brief. Be memorable.

Does that make sense?

## Friday (Mar 06) — Testimonial Day

**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Format:** linkedin

**Source:** Sparsh: Post-Rejection Thank You Email Lands the Job
**From:** ClearCareer - Weekly Group Q&A Call (2024-10-08)
**Speaker:** Sparsh Kalia
**Tags:** #networking, #job_search, #testimonial

### Source Material

> A client applied to a role and was rejected because they had a more qualified candidate. He sent a post-rejection thank you email template anyway. They called him back and offered him the job.
>
> *Direct quote:* "I legit sent your thank you email that you have the template shared with everyone and they offered me the job. That was kind of cool. I didn't expect that at all."

### Draft

I had a client get rejected for a job last week.

They told him they went with a more qualified candidate. Done deal. Door closed.

Here's the thing — he didn't just move on.

He sent a thank you email. After the rejection. He thanked them for their time, expressed genuine interest in the company, and left the door open for future opportunities.

They called him back and offered him the job.

Let that sink in.

The "more qualified candidate" didn't work out? Maybe. But I think something else happened. That email showed them something a resume never could — character, professionalism, and the kind of follow-through that makes someone invaluable on a team.

Most people disappear after a rejection. They ghost. They sulk. They move on to the next application and never look back.

But the candidates who stand out? They're the ones who show up even when there's nothing in it for them.

You'd be surprised how many hiring managers remember the person who was gracious in rejection. You'd be surprised how often "we'll keep you in mind" actually means something when you give them a reason to remember you.

A two-minute email. That's all it took.

So if you've been rejected recently — good. Now you have an opportunity most people waste.

Send the thank you. Be genuine. Keep the door open.

Keep showing up.

What's your experience with post-rejection follow-ups? Drop it in the comments — I bet there are more stories like this than we think.

**Subject: Your Network Is Working Even When You're Not**

You know what I hear every single week? "I'm not good at networking." And every single week, I watch someone prove themselves wrong.

Here's what I've been noticing from the coaching calls lately: the best networking moments aren't happening on LinkedIn. They're happening at birthday parties, through old colleagues, in conversations people didn't plan for. And that's not an accident. That's how this actually works.

## The Reality About How People Get Hired

One of our clients just made it to round 3 at her dream company. Not through a job board. Not through a cold application. Through a warm connection.

Here's what happened: the hiring manager had worked with someone who used to work with our client. That person put in a good word. After the first meeting, the hiring manager messaged the mutual connection and said, "Wow, she's awesome."

Her rule? She doesn't apply unless she can find a connection somewhere. And honestly, that's a rule worth stealing. If it works, copy it and do more.

Another client just moved to a new city. She was celebrating her birthday at a venue and spotted a marketing specialist posting that was a perfect match for her background. She showed up early, introduced herself to the manager, shared her experience. He was immediately engaged — even asked about salary expectations. That's a buying signal. And she hadn't even planned what to say.

Sometimes it works better that way.

Here's what I want you to do: stop treating networking like a formal event you have to prepare for. Start treating it like something that's already happening around you. Every conversation is a potential connection. Every old colleague is a potential bridge. You don't need a script. You need to show up and be genuinely curious about people.

But when you do talk about yourself — and this matters — don't over-explain. Think of it like Stan Miller's airplane metaphor. Get on the plane: just enough context for someone to care. Get off the runway: the interesting part starts. In the air: you in action, doing the thing. Land safely: clear conclusion. Start closer to the action than you think. Nobody needs your full biography. They need to understand what you do and why it matters, fast.

## From the Coaching Calls

**Q: Why do recruiters ghost me? What did I do wrong?**

We had recruiter Yiorgos Boudouris on a call, and he was refreshingly honest: "If I've ever ghosted someone, it's usually by accident. You've gotten lost in the system. I'm getting close to 2000 leads for one role. You physically fall through the cracks."

So if you haven't heard back, it's almost certainly not personal. You didn't bomb it. You didn't say the wrong thing. You just got buried. Which means following up isn't desperate — it's necessary.

## Quick Win

This week, send one message to someone you haven't talked to in six months. Not "Hey, are you hiring?" Just genuine reconnection. Ask what they're working on. Share something you've been up to. That's it. Plant the seed. You don't need to harvest it today.

Keep showing up.

— Izzy

P.S. That client at the birthday party? She wasn't networking. She was just being herself in a room where opportunity existed. You're probably in rooms like that every week. Pay attention.
