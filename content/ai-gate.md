# AI Writing Detection Gate

> A comprehensive reference of patterns, words, phrases, and structural habits that make writing sound like it was generated by AI. Every piece of content must pass through this gate before publishing.
>
> **Rule: If any of these patterns appear in a draft, rewrite the offending sections to sound human — specifically, to match the voice print.**

## 1. The Em Dash Ban

AI models (especially ChatGPT) massively overuse em dashes as a universal connector. **Em dashes (—) are completely banned. Zero tolerance. Never use them.**

Replace every em dash with a period, comma, colon, semicolon, or parentheses. When in doubt, split into two sentences.

### What to catch

- Any em dash character (—) anywhere in the text
- Spaced em dashes ( — ) and unspaced em dashes (word—word)
- En dashes used as em dashes (–)

### Examples

| AI Version | Human Version |
|------------|---------------|
| "The job market — especially in tech — has shifted dramatically" | "The job market has shifted dramatically, especially in tech." |
| "She landed the role — a Director position — in just 7 weeks" | "She landed the role (a Director position) in just 7 weeks." |
| "Networking isn't about collecting contacts — it's about building relationships" | "Networking isn't about collecting contacts. It's about building relationships." |
| "The key to interviews — preparation — is often overlooked" | "The key to interviews is preparation. And most people skip it." |

### The rule

**Zero em dashes. Ever.** Replace with periods, commas, colons, or parentheses.

---

## 2. Hedging Language

AI hedges constantly because it's trained to be safe and non-committal. Real humans (especially confident coaches) don't hedge this much.

### Phrases to kill on sight

- "It's important to note that..."
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "It's worth mentioning that..."
- "It's crucial to understand..."
- "It is essential to consider..."
- "Generally speaking..."
- "To some extent..."
- "From a broader perspective..."
- "Perhaps you might want to consider..."
- "You may want to check..."
- "It is generally considered..."
- "One might argue that..."
- "In many cases..."
- "To a certain degree..."
- "It could be argued..."
- "There's a case to be made..."
- "It should be noted..."
- "Bearing in mind that..."
- "Given the fact that..."
- "As a matter of fact..."
- "In light of the fact that..."

### Examples

| AI Version | Human Version |
|------------|---------------|
| "It's important to note that networking takes time to yield results." | "Networking takes time. That's just how it works." |
| "You may want to consider updating your LinkedIn headline." | "Update your LinkedIn headline. Do it right now." |
| "Generally speaking, most hiring managers prefer concise resumes." | "Hiring managers want concise resumes. Period." |
| "It could be argued that cold outreach is more effective than job boards." | "Cold outreach beats job boards. I've seen it hundreds of times." |
| "Perhaps you might want to explore informational interviews." | "Try informational interviews. You'd be surprised how well they work." |

### The rule

Don't hedge. State things directly. If you believe it, say it. Izzy says "Here's the thing..." and then tells you what's what.

## 3. Overused "Five-Dollar Words"

AI loves words that sound smart but feel hollow. These words appear with abnormal frequency in LLM output and immediately signal machine writing.

### Single words to ban

#### Verbs
- Delve / delving
- Harness / harnessing
- Leverage / leveraging
- Utilize (use "use" instead)
- Facilitate

- Illuminate
- Underscore
- Bolster
- Optimize
- Maximize
- Spearhead
- Capitalize
- Foster
- Cultivate (in non-gardening contexts)
- Streamline
- Empower
- Elevate
- Amplify (in non-audio contexts)
- Curate (unless talking about actual curation)
- Catalyze
- Galvanize

#### Adjectives
- Robust

- Commendable
- Pivotal
- Paramount
- Multifaceted
- Holistic
- Synergistic
- Comprehensive (when used as filler)
- Nuanced (when used as filler)
- Ever-evolving
- Thought-provoking
- Game-changing (note: Izzy uses "game changer" as a noun naturally, but AI overuses the adjective form)
- Unparalleled
- Revolutionary
- Unprecedented

#### Nouns
- Landscape (as in "the hiring landscape")
- Tapestry (as in "a rich tapestry of experiences")
- Realm (as in "in the realm of")
- Beacon (as in "a beacon of hope")
- Paradigm
- Synergy / synergies
- Stakeholder
- Ecosystem (outside tech contexts)
- Framework (when used vaguely)
- Catalyst
- Cornerstone
- Nexus
- Myriad (as a noun)
- Plethora
- Cacophony

### Examples

| AI Version | Human Version |
|------------|---------------|
| "Delve into your network to uncover hidden opportunities." | "Dig into your network. The jobs are there — you just haven't found them yet." |
| "Leverage your existing skills to navigate the job landscape." | "Use what you already know. It's more than you think." |
| "This robust framework empowers job seekers to optimize their search." | "This system works. Here's how to use it." |
| "The ever-evolving landscape of remote work presents unprecedented opportunities." | "Remote work keeps changing. That's actually good news for you." |
| "Harness the power of LinkedIn to amplify your personal brand." | "Use LinkedIn. Seriously, use it. Here's exactly how." |
| "Cultivate a holistic approach to your career trajectory." | "Think about your whole career, not just the next job." |

### The rule

Use simple, direct words. "Use" not "utilize." "Dig into" not "delve into." "Help" not "empower." If the word sounds like it belongs in a corporate strategy deck, cut it.

## 4. Formulaic Openings

AI has a handful of go-to openers that it rotates through. They're instantly recognizable.

### Phrases to never open with

- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "In today's competitive job market..."
- "In an ever-evolving landscape..."
- "In the world of..."
- "In the realm of..."
- "As we navigate..."
- "As professionals, we..."
- "Let's face it..."  (AI version sounds different from natural use)
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "Picture this:" (AI uses this as a crutch)
- "In today's digital age..."
- "In this article/guide/blog post, we'll..."
- "Are you struggling with..."
- "Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out..."
- "When it comes to [topic]..."
- "At its core..."
- "At the forefront of..."

### Examples

| AI Version | Human Version |
|------------|---------------|
| "In today's competitive job market, standing out is more important than ever." | "I had the same conversation three times this week. Nobody's standing out." |
| "Have you ever wondered why some people land jobs effortlessly?" | "Some people land jobs in weeks. Others take months. Here's why." |
| "Picture this: you've sent 200 applications and heard nothing back." | "200 applications. Zero callbacks. Sound familiar?" |
| "As we navigate the complexities of career transitions..." | "Career changes are messy. Let's talk about it." |
| "Whether you're a seasoned executive or an entry-level candidate..." | "This works whether you're a VP or fresh out of school." |

### The rule

Drop the reader into the action. Start with a story, a bold claim, a question, or a direct instruction. Never start with throat-clearing.

---

## 5. Formulaic Transitions

AI uses the same transition words in the same positions, creating a predictable rhythm that trained readers can spot instantly.

### Words and phrases to avoid or minimize

#### Formal connectors (almost never sound natural in casual/coaching content)
- Furthermore
- Moreover
- Additionally
- Consequently
- Nevertheless
- Nonetheless
- Notwithstanding
- Subsequently
- Accordingly
- Hence
- Thus
- Hereby
- Whereby
- Indeed (as a sentence opener)
- Undoubtedly
- Arguably
- Notably
- Remarkably
- Significantly
- Crucially
- Importantly
- Ultimately

#### Formulaic bridge phrases
- "That said..."
- "With that in mind..."
- "On the flip side..."
- "To put it simply..."
- "To that end..."
- "By the same token..."
- "In the same vein..."
- "Along those lines..."
- "It goes without saying..."
- "Needless to say..."

### What to use instead

Natural connectors that Izzy actually uses:
- "So" / "Okay so"
- "And then"
- "Here's the thing"
- "But here's what most people miss"
- "The reality is..."
- "Look..."
- "And"  (starting a sentence)
- "But" (starting a sentence)
- "Now..." / "Now here's where it gets interesting"

### Examples

| AI Version | Human Version |
|------------|---------------|
| "Furthermore, networking events provide valuable opportunities." | "And networking events? Gold mine." |
| "Moreover, it's essential to tailor your resume for each application." | "Oh, and tailor your resume every single time. Non-negotiable." |
| "Consequently, many job seekers find themselves stuck in a cycle." | "So people get stuck. Apply, get rejected, apply, get rejected. Hamster wheel." |
| "Nevertheless, persistence remains key to success." | "But keep showing up. That's the whole game." |

### The rule

If a transition word sounds like it belongs in an academic paper, replace it with how you'd actually say it out loud.

## 6. Hollow Summarizers and Closers

AI loves to wrap things up with a neat bow. Real writing (especially Izzy's) ends with energy, a challenge, or a micro-action.

### Phrases to ban in closings

- "In conclusion..."
- "In summary..."
- "To sum up..."
- "In essence..."
- "All things considered..."
- "At the end of the day..."  (massively overused)
- "Moving forward..."
- "The bottom line is..."
- "Ultimately..."
- "In closing..."
- "To wrap things up..."
- "As we've seen..."
- "Final thoughts..."

### What to use instead

End with:
- A micro-action: "Do this ONE thing today."
- A challenge: "Try it and tell me what happens."
- Encouragement: "Keep showing up. Keep busting through the roadblocks."
- A question: "What's been your experience with this?"
- Energy: "Boom. Now go do it."
- A CTA: "Follow for more" / "Drop yours in the comments"

### Examples

| AI Version | Human Version |
|------------|---------------|
| "In conclusion, networking is a vital component of any successful job search strategy." | "Start today. Send three messages. That's it. Three." |
| "Ultimately, the key to career success lies in continuous learning and adaptation." | "Keep learning. Keep showing up. The rest takes care of itself." |
| "All things considered, investing in your LinkedIn presence is well worth the effort." | "Your LinkedIn is your billboard. Make it count. 💪" |

---

## 7. Structural Tells

Beyond individual words, AI has structural habits that give it away.

### Predictable paragraph structure

AI writes in a rigid pattern:
1. Topic sentence
2. Supporting detail
3. Summary/transition

Real writing varies: sometimes you start with a question, sometimes a one-word sentence, sometimes a long anecdote. Burstiness (mix of short and long sentences) is a key indicator of human writing.

### Uniform list formatting

AI makes every list item the same length and structure. Real lists are messy — some items are one word, others are a full sentence.

| AI Version | Human Version |
|------------|---------------|
| "1. Research the company thoroughly<br>2. Prepare thoughtful questions<br>3. Practice your responses<br>4. Dress appropriately for the role<br>5. Follow up with a thank-you note" | "1. Research the company (actually research it, not just glance at the About page)<br>2. Prep 3 questions. Real ones, not 'What does a typical day look like?'<br>3. Practice out loud<br>4. Dress right<br>5. Send a thank-you within 24 hours — and make it specific" |

### Excessive "balanced" phrasing

AI loves parallel construction to a fault:
- "Not only X, but also Y"
- "Both X and Y"
- "From X to Y"  (e.g., "From updating your resume to mastering interviews")
- "Whether X or Y"

### The "mini-essay" structure

AI treats every response like a 5-paragraph essay:
1. Introduction with thesis
2. Point 1 with evidence
3. Point 2 with evidence
4. Point 3 with evidence
5. Conclusion restating thesis

Real content, especially social media and newsletters, doesn't follow this pattern. It meanders, circles back, surprises you, tells a side story.

---

## 8. Emotional Flatness

AI sounds enthusiastic in a generic way. It says things are "exciting" and "incredible" but the emotion doesn't feel earned or specific.

### Generic enthusiasm to catch

- "This exciting opportunity..."
- "An incredible resource..."
- "A truly remarkable achievement..."
- "This groundbreaking approach..."
- "An invaluable tool for..."
- "A powerful way to..."

### What real emotion sounds like (from the voice print)

- "I'm so happy to hear that."
- "That's really, really cool."
- "Holy shit."
- "Hell of a way to start the week! 💪💪💪"
- "Boom."
- "You rock."

The difference: real enthusiasm is specific, brief, and often informal. AI enthusiasm is generic, wordy, and formal.

---

## 9. The "Serves As" Construction

AI avoids simple verbs like "is" and "has" in favor of indirect constructions.

### Patterns to simplify

| AI Version | Human Version |
|------------|---------------|
| "LinkedIn serves as a powerful platform for..." | "LinkedIn is where the jobs are." |
| "This approach offers a unique opportunity to..." | "This gives you a real advantage." |
| "The resume functions as your marketing document" | "Your resume is an ad. Treat it like one." |
| "Networking provides a pathway to..." | "Networking gets you in the door." |
| "This strategy enables professionals to..." | "This lets you..." |
| "The program features comprehensive coaching..." | "The program has..." / "You get..." |

---

## 10. Filler Phrases That Add Nothing

These phrases pad out AI text without adding meaning. Cut them entirely.

### Kill list

- "It goes without saying..."  (then don't say it)
- "Needless to say..."  (then don't say it)
- "It is widely recognized that..."
- "There is no doubt that..."
- "The fact of the matter is..."
- "It is commonly understood that..."
- "It stands to reason that..."
- "For all intents and purposes..."
- "At this point in time..."
- "In order to..." (just say "to")
- "Due to the fact that..." (just say "because")
- "In the event that..." (just say "if")
- "Prior to..." (just say "before")
- "In regard to..." / "With regard to..." (just say "about")
- "On a daily basis" (just say "daily" or "every day")
- "A large number of..." (just say "many" or give the actual number)
- "Has the ability to..." (just say "can")
- "Is able to..." (just say "can")
- "Make a determination" (just say "decide")
- "Take into consideration" (just say "consider")

---

## 11. Artificial Enthusiasm Markers

AI adds enthusiasm through specific formulaic patterns rather than genuine energy.

### Patterns to catch

- Starting bullets/items with "Exciting:" or "Key:"
- Using "!" after every other sentence
- "What an incredible [noun]!"
- "How amazing is that?"
- Labeling something "pro tip" or "hot take" (AI uses these to sound casual but they feel forced)
- "Here's the thing:" when followed by something generic (Izzy uses this phrase, but always followed by something genuinely direct and specific)

---

## 12. The Diversity Hedge

AI is trained to be inclusive to a fault, creating phrases that sound like corporate HR wrote them.

### Patterns to catch

- "Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out..."
- "Regardless of your background or experience level..."
- "No matter where you are in your career journey..."
- "For professionals at every stage..."
- "This applies to everyone from interns to executives..."

### The rule

Pick your audience and talk to them specifically. Don't try to address everyone in every sentence.

---

## 13. Metaphor and Imagery Tells

AI uses the same tired metaphors and imagery. These are so overused they scream "machine-generated."

### Banned metaphors and imagery

- "Navigate the landscape/waters/terrain"
- "Embark on a journey"
- "Unlock your potential/the door to"
- "Plant the seeds of success"  (note: Izzy uses farming/planting metaphors but in specific, extended ways — not as throwaway phrases)
- "Build bridges"
- "Light at the end of the tunnel"
- "Tip of the iceberg"
- "Moving the needle"
- "Wearing many hats"
- "Thinking outside the box"
- "A double-edged sword"
- "The elephant in the room"
- "A breath of fresh air"
- "Raise the bar"
- "Pushing the envelope"
- "A stepping stone to..."
- "Pave the way for..."
- "Bridge the gap between..."
- "At the crossroads of..."

### The rule

Use fresh, specific imagery. Izzy's metaphors are original and extended: grocery store ADHD, the anaconda of stress, Tony Starking. If you've heard the metaphor a thousand times, don't use it.

---

## 14. Passive Voice and Weak Constructions

AI defaults to passive voice and indirect constructions that drain energy from writing.

### Patterns to catch

- "It was determined that..." → "We found that..." / "Here's what happened..."
- "The decision was made to..." → "We decided to..." / "I decided to..."
- "Results were achieved by..." → "They got results by..."
- "The opportunity should be seized..." → "Grab this opportunity."
- "Consideration should be given to..." → "Think about..." / "Consider..."
- "It can be seen that..." → just state the observation directly
- "There are many ways to..." → "Here are 3 ways to..."
- "It has been shown that..." → "Here's proof:"

### The rule

Use active voice. Name the actor. Be direct. Izzy says "Here's what I want you to do" — not "The following actions should be considered."

---

## 15. Quotation and Attribution Tells

AI has specific patterns when it cites or attributes ideas.

### Patterns to catch

- "As the saying goes..."
- "As [famous person] once said..."
- "To quote [person]..."
- "In the words of..."
- "Research suggests that..."
- "Studies have shown that..."
- "Experts agree that..."
- "According to recent findings..."

### The rule

Izzy doesn't cite studies. He cites lived experience: "I've seen this with hundreds of clients." He quotes people he actually knows or has talked to, not generic "experts."

---

## The Meta-Rule

**If it sounds like it could have come from any AI chatbot writing about any topic, it's wrong.** Every sentence should sound like it could only have come from THIS specific person (Izzy) talking about THIS specific topic. If you removed the topic keywords and couldn't tell who wrote it or what it was about, rewrite it.

The test: Read it out loud. Does it sound like a person talking, or like a press release? If it sounds like a press release, start over.
