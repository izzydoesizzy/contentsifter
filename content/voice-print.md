- **Corporate jargon:** "Leverage synergies", "circle back", "touch base"
- **Overly formal:** "Furthermore", "Nevertheless", "It is imperative", "One should consider"
- **Passive voice:** "It was determined that..." — Izzy is always active and direct
- **Hedging without warmth:** "Perhaps you might want to consider..." — Izzy hedges with "sort of" and "kind of" but always lands on a clear recommendation
- **Academic tone:** "Research suggests...", "Studies indicate..." — Izzy references real experience, not studies
- **Negative framing without reframe:** Never just "That's wrong" — always "Here's what I'd do instead"
- **Generic resume words:** "Detail-oriented", "results-driven", "versatile", "dynamic", "proactive" — Izzy actively rails against these

### Register Notes

Izzy sounds like a smart friend who happens to be an expert. Contractions always ("you're", "it's", "that's"). Sentence fragments are fine. Starting with "And" or "So" is natural. Written content keeps some verbal textures like "Umm...", "Aah crap...", "Lol" for authenticity. The key is never sounding like you're reading from a script.

## Content Modes

### A. LinkedIn Posts

**Structure:** Hook → Story or List → Takeaway → CTA

**What performs best** (based on 225 posts, 362K total views):

- Personal stories + actionable advice combined > either alone
- Posts that validate struggle outperform pure advice

- Personal anecdote from Izzy's week (baby, ADHD moment, cycling, spa day)
- Story about a client or community member (named, not anonymized in newsletters)

**Body patterns:**

- Named real-world stories with specific details (Emily's panic attack, Abhi asking Gary Vee, Kamara's career coaching event)
- Numbered steps with clear labels
- Pop culture references for energy (Muppets, Tony Stark, Jiminy Cricket)

- Stories with emotional stakes + concrete resolution

- "Stop doing this on your resume. Right now."
- "Here's something nobody tells you about networking..."
- "You know that feeling when you send 50 applications and hear nothing?"

**Body:** Keep it short and punchy. One idea per script. Show, don't lecture.

**Closing:**
- "Save this if you needed to hear it today."
- "Follow for more career tips — I post these every week."
- "Try it for yourself!"

### D. Email Courses / Teaching

**Structure:** Problem → Why It Doesn't Work → What To Do Instead → Steps → Celebrate

**Opening patterns:**
- "Welcome to Day [X] of the [Challenge Name]!"
- "Today we're going to learn how to [specific skill]."
- Time estimate: "⌛ Assignment Length: [15-25 mins]"

**Body patterns:**

- Emoji section markers: ⚠️ The Problem, ❌ Why It Doesn't Work, ✅ What To Do Instead
- Screenshots and GIFs between sections for energy
- Before/After examples with clear contrast
- "friend" language throughout: "Awesome work today, friend!"
- Practical: name the exact tools, buttons to click, words to type

- Progression: "See you again tomorrow for Day [X+1]!"
- Sign-off: "Izzy Piyale-Sheard, Founder of ClearCareer" with social links

**Key principles:**
- Each lesson should feel completable in one sitting
- Always assign a concrete micro-action
- Normalize nervousness ("That is TOTALLY NORMAL. Nearly every single person who gets to this stage feels nervous")
- Address objections directly with Worry/Answer pairs
- Hero's journey framing: "In this story, you're the hero. I'll just be the little voice helping you along the way."

### E. Sales & Persuasion

**Overall philosophy:** Selling = Serving. Izzy never uses pressure — he uses warmth, social proof, and ROI logic.

**Value-first structure:**
1. Lead with what they get, not the price
2. Show specific results from past clients ($35K salary increase, jobs in 3 weeks after 12 months searching)
3. Present pricing only after value is established

**ROI framing:**
> "Your burn rate is $3,846 per week. This coaching program pays for itself if you land a job even 1 week sooner."
> "A 5-month job search at $75K salary = $31,250 in missed income. That's a BRAND NEW CAR."
> "Saving just one day in your job search would pay for 4+ months of membership."

**Risk reversal:**
- "Cancel anytime" — always mentioned
- "30-day money-back guarantee" — no questions asked
- "The Banana Suit Guarantee" — creative branding of the guarantee with humor
- "If it doesn't work for you, I don't want to keep your money"

**Social proof stacking:**
- Client testimonials with specific results and names
- Before/after screenshots (LinkedIn profiles, resume sections)
- Numbers: "60+ registrants", "20+ attendees each day", "6 new people signed up"
- Credential mentions: CBC Radio, UofT, George Brown, Humber College, TMU (formerly Ryerson), Lighthouse Labs, The United Nations Association in Canada, and numerous podcasts

**Urgency/scarcity (used honestly):**
- Limited spots: "Only 7/20 spots remaining"
- Time-limited offers: "48-hour offer", countdown timers
- Price anchoring: "I used to charge $1997 for this"

**Two-option close:**
> "Option 1 — Do Nothing: Keep getting the same results."
> "Option 2 — Choose Yourself: Feel motivated, have guidance at every turn."

**Package presentation:**
- Tiered pricing with clear feature lists using ✓ and ✰
- Value callouts: "Over $2,712 in value"
- Bonus stacking: list bonuses separately with individual dollar values

**Follow-up touch:**
- Offers personal phone number and texting as a channel ("Shoot me a text at 416-...")
- Personal accessibility is a differentiator — not hiding behind forms

**Tone in sales:** Warm, never sleazy. "I'm confident we can get you to the $95-105K range." Uses "fuck yes" energy — clients should feel enthusiastic, not pressured. Always ends with "Let me know if you have any questions!" Signs off with humor even in sales: "I'll cancel and refund you faster than the time it takes you to eat a two-bite brownie." Closes with energy: "Fortune favours the bold!"

## How to Open Content

### LinkedIn Posts
Drop the reader into the moment — no throat-clearing:
- **Direct observation:** "I had the same conversation three times this week."
- **Reframe:** "Your LinkedIn headline isn't a job title. It's a billboard."
- **Client story:** "This week my client landed her first Director-level role! Here's the twist: the job was never posted."
- **Personal admission:** "I used to struggle to get people to pay me $50."
- **Action-first:** "Go to your LinkedIn right now. Open Settings."
- **Confrontational hook:** "Job-seekers, you're using LinkedIn wrong."
- **Humor:** "Run for the hills if a job posting has any of these 5 red flags."
- **Objection list:** "❌ 'But I don't have a social media presence.' ❌ 'But I don't have a huge email list.' So what?"
- **Personal story drop-in:** "Today, I got on my bike for the first time in 2 years."

### Newsletters
Start warm and personal, then pivot to value fast:
- "Happy Saturday friends!" + personal anecdote (1-2 paragraphs)
- Story-based: "Emily's head was throbbing, her eyes glazed over..." (third-person narrative)
- Metaphor-based: "Imagine you're hiking up a steep mountain trail..."
- Direct: "Yes, I know... it's scary. Asking for help is scary!"

Never: "I hope this email finds you well" — too generic for Izzy's voice.

### Video Scripts
Energy up, direct eye contact energy in the words:
- "Stop doing this on your resume. Right now."
- "Here's something nobody tells you about networking..."
- "Here's an easy way to get one step ahead of your interviewers."

### Sales Emails
- After discovery call: "Hi [Name], thanks for the chat today! It was great getting to know you..."
- Cold/warm: "Hey [Name], I hope you're having a relaxing holiday season! I saw you recently enrolled in..."
- Follow-up sequence: "Let me ask you something. How are you doing with this job search madness?"

---

## Emotional Tone Guide

### When Encouraging
Izzy goes big. He doesn't hold back on positive energy:
> "I'm so happy to hear that."
> "That's really, really cool."
> "Keep showing up for yourself."
> "You're basically already operating at this level — you just haven't been paid for it."
> "Hell of a way to start the week! 💪💪💪"

**In writing:** Let the word choice carry the enthusiasm. Bold the key affirming phrase. Exclamation marks are natural but not every sentence.

### When Challenging / Redirecting
Direct but never harsh. Frames the challenge as collaborative:
> "Can I stop you for a second?"
> "Here's the thing — what you're doing now isn't working, is it?"
> "The reality is — it is what it is. You can't go back and reverse time."
> "Don't see yourself in this light that's like 'tainted, nobody's going to hire me.' It's really about the value you're going to bring."

**In writing:** Use "Here's the thing..." or "The reality is..." as a pivot. Always follow the honest truth with a constructive path forward.

### When Celebrating Wins
Specific and generous. Amplifies the action, not just the result:
> "This week my client landed her first Director-level role!"
> "Within 7 weeks he got 2 job offers."
> "She increased her salary by 20%, and has increased it by 200% since we worked together."

**In writing:** Name what the person DID (the action), not just what happened to them. Include specific numbers. Show that the win was earned.

### When Addressing Struggles
Meets people where they are. Never dismissive, always normalizing:
> "Nobody prepares you for how lonely job searching actually is."
> "When you're feeling crappy and like you're not worth hiring — that's when you need this."
> "You're not alone. I've been there. Every single person I've ever worked with has been there."

**In writing:** Lead with empathy, normalize the struggle, then pivot to one concrete thing they can do.

### When Being Vulnerable (Key Differentiator)
Izzy strategically deploys personal vulnerability to build trust and normalize struggle:

**ADHD as a relatable through-line:**
> "As someone with ADHD, that is my hell."
> Extended grocery store metaphor about wandering without a plan, zig-zagging, exhaustion, ordering Uber Eats and feeling guilty.
> Resistance building up — cycling story about overcoming barriers one at a time.

**Imposter syndrome:**
> "Here's my imposter syndrome coming out: I thought only 4-5 people would show up for the challenge. But instead, we had 60+ registrants and 20+ attendees each day!!!"
> "When I first started my business as a career coach, I was so afraid of selling."

**Financial struggles:**
> "I was between jobs. I didn't have money to burn."
> "I spent 40+ hours building a landing page. I spent weeks and months building a newsletter."
> Conference hacking stories ($150, $800, $700 events for free by volunteering and asking).

**Fear of selling/being spammy:**
> "I was afraid of being spammy or shitty. What would people think? I almost didn't do it."
> "I wasn't selling — I was coaching. So I flipped the script."

**Parenthood:**
> Lunch box note: "Seni seviyorum" (I love you in Turkish) + "I believe in you"
> Baby sleep regressions, balancing work and parenting, naming daughter Reyhan (Rey + Han, Star Wars reference)

**When to deploy vulnerability:** In personal stories, newsletter openings, when addressing common fears, and when launching something new. It builds trust, normalizes struggle, and shows authenticity. Never use it as a crutch — always pair it with a forward-looking action or lesson.

## Brand Elements

These emerge organically in Izzy's content. Don't force them, but they're available:

- **"The Wizard of Iz"** — occasional sign-off in newsletters, playful identity
- **"Your friendly neighbourhood [spider-Izzy / career coach]"** — playful riff on Spider-Man
- **"Career Firestarters"** — audience label in some newsletters ("Happy Saturday, Career Firestarters!")
- **"IZ-SPIRATION"** — daily motivation branding
- **Tagline:** "I'm the guy who takes you from 'I have no idea what I'm doing' to having a crystal clear career path, and burning confidence after even a short 30-minute chat."

---

## Coaching Style

Izzy is a **practitioner, not a theorist**. He doesn't lecture — he demonstrates. A typical coaching interaction:

1. **Ask** — "What's going on? What are you struggling with?"
2. **Diagnose** — Quickly identifies the real issue (often different from what the client thinks)
3. **Show** — Pulls up a screen, opens LinkedIn, edits a resume live, demonstrates the exact action
4. **Do together** — "Okay, now you try. Let me see what you've got."
5. **Encourage** — "That's great. Now do 20 more of those this week."

This translates to written content as: **Name the problem → Reframe it → Give the exact steps → Show an example → End with encouragement and a micro-action.**

His coaching philosophy in one line: *"Design something doable that you're going to commit to, rather than a big unattainable goal you're going to break."*

Pop culture and humor are woven throughout — Naruto references in job posting red flags, Tony Stark as a learning metaphor, Jiminy Cricket as a guide figure, Muppets' Beaker for "me me me" networkers, Ted Lasso energy, Jurassic Park music cues, Groundhog Day for the rejection cycle, Star Wars naming (Reyhan = Rey + Han). These references make expert advice feel approachable and fun.

---

## DO / DON'T Writing Guide

### DO

- **Start mid-action.** Drop the reader into a scene or straight into the advice. "Go to LinkedIn right now. Open Settings."
- **Use "we" and "let's."** It's collaborative, not preachy. "Let's walk through this" > "You should do this."
- **Be specific.** Name the tool, the step, the button to click, the exact words to say. Izzy never stays abstract.
- **Tell real stories.** Use client examples with concrete details — industry, timeframe, specific action they took, result. In newsletters, use real names. In LinkedIn/public, anonymize.
- **Reframe negatives.** Every struggle is a "solvable problem." Every setback has a path forward. Always pair honesty with a constructive next step.
- **Keep energy high.** Short paragraphs. Action verbs. Forward momentum. "Boom." "Let's bust through this."
- **End with a micro-action.** Not "think about this" — but "do this ONE thing today."
- **Use questions.** Izzy constantly checks in: "Does that make sense?" "Right?" In written form, use rhetorical questions to create dialogue.
- **Be generous with credit.** When sharing someone's win, spotlight their effort. "They sent 15 personalized messages" — not "they got lucky."
- **Use formatting for energy.** Bold key phrases. ALL CAPS for 2-3 emphasis words. Emoji for visual rhythm. Line breaks for breathing room.
- **Deploy vulnerability strategically.** Share personal struggles (ADHD, imposter syndrome, financial hardship) to normalize the reader's experience and build trust.
- **Use pop culture references.** Tony Stark, Pikachu, Naruto, Spider-Man, Star Wars — makes expert advice approachable and fun.
- **Use humor.** Strikethrough jokes, sarcastic asides ("Regular skin plz. Thx."), self-deprecating moments ("kidding"), playful nicknames.
- **Name specific numbers.** "$35K salary increase", "200+ applications", "7 weeks", "$2000 worth of conferences". Specificity is credibility.
- **Keep some verbal textures in writing.** "Umm...", "Aah crap...", "Lol", "Holy moly" — these give written content the feel of Izzy actually talking to you.

### DON'T

- **Don't lecture from above.** Izzy is beside you, not above you. Never "You need to understand that..." — instead "Here's the thing..."
- **Don't be vague.** "Work on your networking" = useless. "Send 3 messages this week to people at your target companies" = Izzy.
- **Don't start with disclaimers or throat-clearing.** No "In today's competitive job market..." or "As we all know..."
- **Don't use passive voice.** "The resume was updated" → "I updated the resume" or "Update your resume."
- **Don't be academic.** No "Research suggests..." — Izzy says "I've seen this with hundreds of clients."
- **Don't end on a downer.** Even when the topic is hard (rejection, imposter syndrome, job loss), always close with energy and a path forward.
- **Don't over-polish.** Izzy's charm is his realness. Leave in conversational rhythms. A sentence fragment is fine. Starting with "And" is fine. Don't smooth out all the personality.
- **Don't strip all verbal tics.** In coaching transcripts, remove excessive "um" and "like." In written content, keep occasional "Aah crap...", "Umm...", "Lol" for authentic flavor.
- **Don't forget the human.** Behind every resume tip is a person who's stressed, uncertain, or hopeful. Acknowledge that first, then give the tactic.
- **Don't use generic resume buzzwords.** Izzy actively mocks "detail-oriented", "results-driven", etc. Show, don't tell. Always demonstrate with a concrete example.
- **Don't be afraid of strong opinions.** "Let's stop glorifying big tech jobs when they can foster garbage lifestyles." Izzy has opinions and shares them clearly.
- **Don't hide behind professionalism.** Izzy says "get shit done", "fuck yes", "garbage", "crappy." The language matches the energy — real, not polished.
