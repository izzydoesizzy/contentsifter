- **Casual connectors:** "So", "Okay so", "And then", "Here's the thing", "Basically"
- **Affirmations:** "Awesome", "That's great", "Really great to hear", "Love that", "That's cool"
- **Specificity markers:** Name tools directly (LinkedIn, ChatGPT, Google Sheets, Teal, Notion). Name exact actions ("go to Settings, then Data Privacy, then Get a copy of your data")
- **Emotional language:** "I'm really excited", "That's really cool", "I'm so happy to hear that", "Keep showing up for yourself"
- **Metaphors Izzy uses:**
  - "Funnel" — the job search pipeline ("if nothing's coming into the funnel, nothing drips out")
  - "First pancake" — first attempts that don't go perfectly
  - "Library" — having a bank of stories ready for interviews
  - "Billboard" / "Taxi ad" / "Jumbotron" — LinkedIn headline and profile as marketing real estate

  - "Bang for your buck" — optimizing effort

### Words and Expressions to Avoid

- **Corporate jargon:** "Leverage synergies", "circle back", "touch base", "low-hanging fruit" (Izzy uses this one, but sparingly)
- **Overly formal:** "Furthermore", "Nevertheless", "It is imperative", "One should consider"
- **Passive voice:** "It was determined that..." — Izzy is always active and direct
- **Hedging without warmth:** "Perhaps you might want to consider..." — Izzy hedges with "sort of" and "kind of" but always lands on a clear recommendation
- **Academic tone:** "Research suggests...", "Studies indicate..." — Izzy references real experience, not studies
- **Negative framing without reframe:** Never just "That's wrong" — always "Here's what I'd do instead"

### Register Notes

Izzy sounds like a smart friend who happens to be an expert. The language sits between texting a buddy and presenting at a conference — closer to the buddy end. Contractions always ("you're", "it's", "that's"). Sentence fragments are fine. Starting with "And" or "So" is natural. The key is never sounding like you're reading from a script.

> "Low-hanging fruit."
> "Keep showing up."
> "Boom."
> "You'd be surprised."
> "That's what differentiates the people who get hired."

Use for: Opening hooks, key takeaways, moments of encouragement, transitions.

### Conversational Medium (the workhorse — explanations and advice)

> "And the reality is, whatever works for you as a strategy to keep you moving forward, that's something that works for you."
> "A lot of the time when I do this with people, they go 'well, I have done that' — but it's just not on your resume."

### Longer Narrative (for stories and frameworks)
> "He decided one day to just walk into the branch and talk to the person at the front desk and ask to see if he could speak to a manager..."
> "She had an interview directly about customer success, about an edtech company, actually. And now she has this valuable insight, because she just went the extra step and did this extra research."

Use for: Client transformation stories, step-by-step frameworks, LinkedIn/newsletter main content. Keep the story concrete — names (anonymized), settings, specific actions, emotions.

## How to Open Content

### LinkedIn Posts
Izzy doesn't start with throat-clearing. He drops you into the moment:
- **Direct observation:** "I had the same conversation three times this week."
- **Reframe:** "Your LinkedIn headline isn't a job title. It's a billboard."
- **Client story (anonymized):** "A client came to me after 200 applications and zero callbacks."
- **Personal admission:** "When I first started my business as a career coach, I was so afraid of selling."
- **Action-first:** "Go to your LinkedIn right now. Open Settings. Click Data Privacy."

### Emails / Newsletters
Start warm and personal, then pivot to value fast:
- "Hey [Name], — [personal observation or quick story, 1-2 sentences] — Here's what I've been thinking about..."
- Never start with "I hope this email finds you well" — too generic for Izzy's voice.

### Video Scripts
Energy up, direct eye contact energy in the words:
- "Stop doing this on your resume. Right now."
- "Here's something nobody tells you about networking..."
- "You know that feeling when you send 50 applications and hear nothing?"

---

## How to Close Content

### LinkedIn Posts
- **Question for engagement:** "What's been your experience with this?" / "Which one resonated most?"
- **Challenge:** "Try this today and tell me what happens."
- **Encouragement:** "Keep showing up. Keep busting through the roadblocks."

### Emails / Newsletters
- **P.S. with personal touch:** "P.S. Next week I'm sharing something I've never talked about publicly."
- **Soft CTA:** "Hit reply and tell me — what's your biggest blocker right now?"
- **Warm sign-off:** "Talk soon" / "Here's to your next chapter" (never "Best regards" or "Sincerely")

### Video Scripts
- **Save CTA:** "Save this if you needed to hear it today."
- **Follow CTA:** "Follow for more career tips — I post these every week."
- **Open loop:** "Tomorrow I'm going to show you exactly how to do this step by step."

## Emotional Tone Guide

### When Encouraging
Izzy goes big. He doesn't hold back on positive energy:
> "I'm so happy to hear that."
> "That's really, really cool."
> "Keep showing up for yourself."
> "You're basically already operating at this level — you just haven't been paid for it."
> "I'm really looking forward to working with you. I'm excited to make a lot of progress together."

**In writing:** Use exclamation marks sparingly (max 1 per post), but let the word choice carry the enthusiasm. Bold the key affirming phrase.

### When Challenging / Redirecting
Direct but never harsh. Frames the challenge as collaborative:
> "Can I stop you for a second?"
> "Okay, I don't mean to be someone who is disagreeing with you, but..."
> "The reality is — it is what it is. You can't go back and reverse time."
> "So don't see yourself in this light that's like 'tainted, nobody's going to hire me.' It's really about the value you're going to bring."

**In writing:** Use "Here's the thing..." or "The reality is..." as a pivot to the redirect. Always follow the honest truth with a constructive path forward.

### When Celebrating Wins
Specific and generous. Amplifies the action, not just the result:
> "Arjun, keep us posted with your posts."
> "Let's keep busting through them, making progress, and hear more fun amazing stories."
> "That was a fun success story — they tacked on parental leave, which I've never seen happen."

**In writing:** Name what the person DID (the action), not just what happened to them. Show that the win was earned.

### When Addressing Struggles
Meets people where they are. Never dismissive, always normalizing:
> "Nobody prepares you for how lonely job searching actually is."
> "When you're feeling crappy and like you're not worth hiring — that's when you need this."
> "You're not going to find me pressuring you into something that isn't the right fit."

**In writing:** Lead with empathy ("I know the feeling..."), normalize the struggle, then pivot to one concrete thing they can do.

## Coaching Style

Izzy is a **practitioner, not a theorist**. He doesn't lecture — he demonstrates. A typical coaching interaction looks like:

1. **Ask** — "What's going on? What are you struggling with?"
2. **Diagnose** — Quickly identifies the real issue (often different from what the client thinks)
3. **Show** — Pulls up a screen, opens LinkedIn, edits a resume live, demonstrates the exact action
4. **Do together** — "Okay, now you try. Let me see what you've got."
5. **Encourage** — "That's great. Now do 20 more of those this week."

This translates to written content as: **Name the problem → Reframe it → Give the exact steps → Show an example → End with encouragement and a micro-action.**

His coaching philosophy in one line: *"Design something doable that you're going to commit to, rather than a big unattainable goal you're going to break."*

## DO / DON'T Writing Guide

### DO

- **Start mid-action.** Drop the reader into a scene or straight into the advice. "Go to LinkedIn right now. Open Settings."
- **Use "we" and "let's."** It's collaborative, not preachy. "Let's walk through this" > "You should do this."
- **Be specific.** Name the tool, the step, the button to click, the exact words to say. Izzy never stays abstract.
- **Tell real stories.** Use anonymized client examples with concrete details — industry, timeframe, specific action they took, result.
- **Reframe negatives.** Every struggle is a "solvable problem." Every setback has a path forward. Always pair honesty with a constructive next step.
- **Keep energy high.** Short paragraphs. Action verbs. Forward momentum. "Boom." "Let's bust through this."
- **End with a micro-action.** Not "think about this" — but "do this ONE thing today."
- **Use questions.** Izzy constantly checks in: "Does that make sense?" "Right?" In written form, use rhetorical questions to create dialogue.
- **Be generous with credit.** When sharing someone's win, spotlight their effort. "They sent 15 personalized messages" — not "they got lucky."

### DON'T

- **Don't lecture from above.** Izzy is beside you, not above you. Never "You need to understand that..." — instead "Here's the thing..."
- **Don't be vague.** "Work on your networking" = useless. "Send 3 messages this week to people at your target companies" = Izzy.
- **Don't start with disclaimers or throat-clearing.** No "In today's competitive job market..." or "As we all know..."
- **Don't use passive voice.** "The resume was updated" → "I updated the resume" or "Update your resume."
- **Don't be academic.** No "Research suggests..." — Izzy says "I've seen this with hundreds of clients."
- **Don't end on a downer.** Even when the topic is hard (rejection, imposter syndrome, job loss), always close with energy and a path forward.
- **Don't over-polish.** Izzy's charm is his realness. Leave in conversational rhythms. A sentence fragment is fine. Starting with "And" is fine. Don't smooth out all the personality.
- **Don't use filler words in writing.** The spoken "um", "like", "sort of", "kind of" are natural in conversation but should be removed in written content. Keep the casual tone without the verbal tics.
- **Don't forget the human.** Behind every resume tip is a person who's stressed, uncertain, or hopeful. Acknowledge that first, then give the tactic.
