Structures, patterns, and formulas for writing email newsletters that
get opened, read, and acted on.

## Email Structure Patterns

### 1. SOAP — Story, Observation, Application, Prompt

Best for: weekly editions. Creates emotional connection then delivers value.

```
SUBJECT: [Curiosity-driven, 6-10 words]
PREVIEW: [40-90 chars that complement, not repeat, the subject]

---

Hey [First Name],

**STORY** (3-4 sentences)
[Open with a client story, personal anecdote, or observation from the week.
 Use specific details — names (anonymized), settings, emotions.]

**OBSERVATION** (2-3 sentences)
[What pattern or insight does this reveal? Zoom out.
 Connect the specific to the universal.]

**APPLICATION** (bullet points or short numbered list)
[How can the reader apply this? Be specific.
 - Do [this] when [situation]
 - Try [action] this week
 - Avoid [mistake] because [reason]]

**PROMPT** (1-2 sentences)
[Close with a question, micro-challenge, or call-to-action.
 "This week, try..." or "Reply and tell me..."]

Talk soon,
[Name]

P.S. [Personal touch, teaser for next week, or soft coaching CTA]
```

### 2. Value-First

Best for: establishing expertise. Leads with an immediately useful tip.

```
SUBJECT: [Benefit-driven: "How to X" or "The Y that changes everything"]

---

**QUICK WIN** (first 2 sentences)
[Start with one thing they can do RIGHT NOW. No preamble.
 "Here's something you can do in the next 5 minutes..."]

**DEEP DIVE** (3-4 paragraphs, ~300-500 words)
[The main content. One focused topic.
 Use headers, bold text, and short paragraphs.
 Include a framework, process, or contrarian take.]

**RESOURCE** (1-2 sentences)
[Link to a tool, article, video, or template.
 "I found this helpful..." or "Here's a resource I send to every client..."]

**P.S.**
[Personal touch or teaser. This is the second-most-read part of the email.]
```

### 3. Curated Digest

Best for: when you don't have a deep-dive topic. Quick to write, high value.

```
SUBJECT: "[Topic] Digest: [Number] things I noticed this week"

---

**THIS WEEK'S INSIGHT** (1 original thought, 2-3 sentences)
[Your take on something happening in the job market / career world]

**FROM THE COACHING CALLS** (anonymized)
[One real Q&A or tip from a recent coaching session.
 Format as: "Q: [question]" / "A: [your advice]"]

**RESOURCE ROUNDUP** (3 items, each with 1-sentence commentary)
1. [Link] — [Why it's worth reading]
2. [Link] — [Why it's worth reading]
3. [Link] — [Why it's worth reading]

**WIN OF THE WEEK**
[Anonymized client success story. 2-3 sentences.
 Celebrate the action they took, not just the result.]

Until next time,
[Name]
```

## Subject Line Formulas

### Curiosity Gap
- "The [unexpected thing] about [topic]"
- "What [impressive person] taught me about [topic]"
- "I was wrong about [thing everyone believes]"

### Benefit-Driven
- "How to [achieve result] without [painful thing]"
- "[Number] [things] I tell every [audience member]"
- "The fastest way to [desired outcome]"

### Pain-Point
- "Why [common approach] isn't working for you"
- "Stop doing [thing]. Start doing [this]."
- "If you're [struggling with X], read this."

### Social Proof
- "[Client name] went from [before] to [after]"
- "What my most successful clients all do"
- "The advice I give more than any other"

### Personal/Relatable
- "An honest conversation about [hard topic]"
- "What I wish I'd known about [topic]"
- "A question I get asked every single week"

### Rules for subject lines:
- 6-10 words (40-60 characters ideal)
- Preview text should COMPLEMENT, not repeat
- Test: would YOU click this in a crowded inbox?
- Avoid: ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation!!!, clickbait you can't deliver on

---

## Open-Loop Patterns

Use these to keep readers engaged through the email:

- **Teaser in subject, deliver in body:** Subject says "the one thing..." — body reveals it halfway through
- **P.S. open loop:** "Next week, I'm sharing [something intriguing]..."
- **Nested story:** Start a story, pause to teach, finish the story at the end
- **Series:** "This is part 1 of 3..." (drives opens for the next emails)

---

## Segmentation Triggers

Questions to include that help you segment your list:

- "Reply with 'RESUME' if you want me to cover resume tips next week"
- "Click here if you're currently job searching / Click here if you're exploring"
- "What's your #1 challenge right now? [Link to poll]"
