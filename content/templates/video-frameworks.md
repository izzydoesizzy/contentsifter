# Short-Form Video Frameworks

Script structures, hook patterns, and retention techniques for TikTok,
Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and LinkedIn native video.

---

## The Golden Rules

1. **First 3 seconds decide everything.** Your hook must stop the scroll.
2. **One idea per video.** If you have three tips, make three videos.
3. **Spoken word + text overlay = maximum retention.** Always use captions.
4. **End with a reason to follow.** CTA or open loop.
5. **30-60 seconds is the sweet spot** for career advice content.

## Hook Patterns (first 3 seconds)

### Direct Challenge
> "Stop applying to jobs this way."
> "You're writing your resume wrong."
> "Delete this line from your LinkedIn."

### Shocking Stat or Claim
> "87% of resumes get rejected before a human sees them."
> "The average job posting gets 250 applications."
> "Recruiters spend 6 seconds on your resume."

### Story Loop
> "A client came to me after 200 applications and zero callbacks..."
> "Last week, someone got hired because of one email..."
> "I almost gave a client terrible advice. Here's what happened."

### POV / Relatable
> "POV: You just got ghosted after a final round interview"
> "POV: You're rewriting your resume for the 47th time"
> "That feeling when the recruiter says 'we went with another candidate'..."

### Pattern Interrupt
> [Start mid-sentence] "...and that's exactly why it doesn't work."
> [Unusual visual/action] + "Here's what nobody tells you about [topic]"
> [Hold up object/prop] "This is your resume. This is what recruiters actually see."

### Question Hook
> "Want to know the #1 thing recruiters look for?"
> "Why do some people land jobs in 2 weeks while others take 6 months?"
> "What would you say if a hiring manager asked you this?"

## Script Structures

### Quick Tip (30-45 seconds)

Best for: single actionable insight. Highest volume format.

```
[0-3s]  HOOK: "[Direct challenge or bold claim]"
[3-10s] SETUP: "Here's why this matters..." (1-2 sentences of context)
[10-30s] TIP: "[The actual advice — be specific and concrete]"
[30-40s] PROOF: "[Quick example or result]" (optional)
[40-45s] CTA: "Follow for more career tips" / "Save this"
```

**Fill-in template:**
```
HOOK: "Stop [common mistake]. Do [better thing] instead."

SETUP: "Most [audience] think [misconception].
        But [what's actually true]."

TIP: "Instead, try [specific action].
      [Step 1]. [Step 2]. [Step 3]."

CTA: "Follow for more [topic] tips."
```

### Story-Driven (45-60 seconds)

Best for: transformation stories, lessons learned. Highest share rate.

```
[0-3s]  HOOK: "[Dramatic setup — the before state]"
[3-15s] BEFORE: "[Paint the struggle. Make viewer feel it.]"
[15-30s] TURNING POINT: "[What changed — the insight, action, or conversation]"
[30-45s] AFTER: "[The result. Be specific: numbers, emotions, outcomes.]"
[45-55s] LESSON: "[The takeaway the viewer can apply]"
[55-60s] CTA: "Have you experienced this? Tell me in the comments."
```

**Fill-in template:**
```
HOOK: "[Person/client] was [struggling with X] for [time period]."

BEFORE: "They had tried [things that didn't work].
         [Vivid emotional detail — how it felt]."

TURNING POINT: "Then we [specific action or realization].
               The key was [insight]."

AFTER: "[Time later], they [specific positive result].
        [One emotional detail — how it felt now]."

LESSON: "The lesson? [Universal takeaway].
         If you're [in similar situation], try [action]."

CTA: "Save this if you needed to hear it today."
```

### Talking Head with Text Overlay

Best for: tips, explanations, opinion pieces. The workhorse format.

**Production checklist:**
- Face on camera, good lighting, clean background
- Key words appear as large text overlays as you say them
- Captions always on (80% of social video is watched on mute)
- Eye contact with camera lens (not screen)
- Change angle or zoom every 5-7 seconds to maintain attention
- 100-150 words total (30-60 seconds when spoken naturally)

**Text overlay strategy:**
- Overlay the KEYWORDS, not full sentences
- 3-5 words max per overlay
- Time overlays to appear as you say them
- Use bold, high-contrast text (white with black outline)

### Screen Share Tutorial

Best for: LinkedIn profile tips, resume reviews, tool demos.

**Structure:**
```
[0-3s]  HOOK: "Let me show you [what to do / what's wrong]"
[3-10s] SETUP: Show the screen. Point out the problem.
[10-40s] FIX: Walk through the steps. Narrate every click.
[40-50s] RESULT: Show the before/after side by side.
[50-60s] CTA: "Want me to review yours? Drop it in the comments."
```

### The "3 Types" Framework

Best for: categorization content. Very shareable.

```
[HOOK] "There are 3 types of [job seekers / networkers / interviewers]"
[TYPE 1] "[Description]" — [Visual or text: "Type 1: The ___"]
[TYPE 2] "[Description]" — [Visual or text: "Type 2: The ___"]
[TYPE 3] "[Description]" — [Visual or text: "Type 3: The ___"]
[REVEAL] "Which one are you? Comment below."
```

## Retention Techniques

These keep viewers watching past the first few seconds:

1. **Open loop in the hook:** "By the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to..."
   (Viewer stays to get the payoff)

2. **Visual changes every 3-5 seconds:** Zoom in/out, angle change, text pop,
   b-roll insert, hand gesture. Static frames lose viewers.

3. **Pattern interrupts:** Unexpected sound, jump cut, change in energy,
   on-screen text that contradicts what you're saying.

4. **Countdown/progression:** "Tip #1... Tip #2... Tip #3..."
   (Viewer stays to see all of them)

5. **Delayed payoff:** "The last one is the most important" or
   "But the real trick is..." (said at 70% mark)

6. **Save CTA:** "You're going to want to save this one."
   (Signals high value, increases saves which boosts algorithm)

## Platform-Specific Notes

### TikTok
- Trending sounds boost discoverability (even at low volume under voiceover)
- Hashtags: 3-5, mix broad (#careertok) with niche (#resumetips)
- Best posting times: 7-9 AM, 12-3 PM, 7-11 PM

### Instagram Reels
- Cover image matters (appears on profile grid)
- Use Instagram's native text tool for overlays
- Hashtags in caption, not on screen
- Cross-post from TikTok but remove watermark

### YouTube Shorts
- Title and first frame are critical (appear in Shorts shelf)
- Can be up to 60 seconds
- Add to a "Shorts" playlist for organization
- Drives subscribers better than other short-form platforms

### LinkedIn Native Video
- Vertical OR square format both work
- Add a text post alongside the video for context
- Captions are essential (autoplay is muted)
- Tag relevant people or companies
- Best for thought leadership and professional tips
