motivation for buying.

## Template 1: Pain-Point Pitch

**Best for:** People who are actively struggling and ready for help.

```
SUBJECT: Tired of [specific pain point]?
PREVIEW: There's a better way (and I can prove it)

---

Hey [First Name],

Let me ask you something:

How many hours have you spent this month [describe the struggle]?

[Specific pain point example — make them feel seen]
[Another example]
[And another]

It doesn't have to be this way.

[Bridge to your solution — 2-3 sentences about what you offer
 and WHY it works]

Here's what you get:

- [Specific deliverable 1]
- [Specific deliverable 2]
- [Specific deliverable 3]
- [Specific deliverable 4]

[Social proof — ONE specific client result, anonymized]

[CTA button/link: "Book a free discovery call" or "Learn more"]

[Scarcity/urgency — but only if genuine:
 "I take on [X] new clients per month to keep things personal."
 "The next cohort starts [date]."]

## Template 2: Testimonial-Led

**Best for:** Social proof-driven prospects who need to see results first.

```
SUBJECT: "[Specific result]" — how [Anonymized Name] did it in [timeframe]
PREVIEW: Their exact path from [before] to [after]

---

Hey [First Name],

[Anonymized Name] told me something during our first call that I hear
all the time:

"[Direct quote expressing a common fear/frustration — anonymized]"

Sound familiar?

Here's what happened next:

**Month 1:** [What they worked on. Specific actions.]
**Month 2:** [The turning point. What shifted.]
**Month 3:** [The result. Specific outcomes.]

[Name] isn't an outlier. Here's what a few others have said:

> "[Short testimonial quote 1]"
> "[Short testimonial quote 2]"
> "[Short testimonial quote 3]"

If you're in a similar spot, I'd love to help you write a similar story.

## Template 3: FAQ / Objection Handler

**Best for:** People who are interested but have hesitations.

```
SUBJECT: Your questions about [program name], answered honestly
PREVIEW: Including the one everyone's afraid to ask

---

Hey [First Name],

I get a lot of questions about [Program Name]. Here are the most
common ones — answered honestly:

**"Is it worth the investment?"**
[Answer — reframe around cost of NOT acting. Use a specific example.]

**"I don't have time for a program right now."**
[Answer — address the time commitment realistically. Show how it
 actually saves time.]

**"What if I'm not ready to make a change yet?"**
[Answer — meet them where they are. Show it works for explorers too.]

**"How is this different from [alternative]?"**
[Answer — honest differentiation. Don't bash competitors.]

**"What if it doesn't work for me?"**
[Answer — address risk. Guarantees, testimonials, or flexible options.]

Still have questions? Hit reply. I answer every email personally.

Or if you're ready: [CTA link]

P.S. The question nobody asks but everyone thinks: "[Common unspoken
concern]." My answer: [Honest, empathetic response.]
