```
SUBJECT: Welcome! Here's your first career win
PREVIEW: One thing you can do in the next 5 minutes

---

Hey [First Name],

Welcome to [Newsletter Name]!

I'm Izzy, and I help career changers and job seekers go from stuck and
overwhelmed to confident and hired.

Here's a quick win you can do right now — it takes less than 5 minutes:

[INSERT: One specific, immediately actionable tip. Examples:
 - "Open LinkedIn. Change your headline from your job title to:
   [What you do] | Helping [who] achieve [what] | [Key skill]"
 - "Go to your resume. Delete your objective statement. Replace it with
   a 2-sentence summary of your biggest professional achievement."
 - "Send one message today to someone you haven't talked to in 6 months.
   Just say: 'Hey! I was thinking about you. How are things going?'"]

Every [day of week], I'll send you actionable advice from real coaching
sessions with people just like you — career changers, job seekers, and
professionals ready for what's next.

Talk soon,
Izzy

P.S. Tomorrow I'm going to tell you why I started doing this — and the
moment that changed everything.

## Email 2: Origin Story
**Send:** Day 2
**Goal:** Build connection through vulnerability, establish credibility

```
SUBJECT: Why I became a career coach (the honest version)
PREVIEW: It started with a conversation I'll never forget

---

Hey [First Name],

[INSERT: Your origin story. Structure:

 Paragraph 1 — The moment. A specific conversation, event, or
 realization that set you on this path. Concrete details.

 Paragraph 2 — The problem you saw. What was broken about how
 people approached career changes? What frustrated you?

 Paragraph 3 — What you built. How the coaching program came
 to be. What makes your approach different.

 Paragraph 4 — The result. What your clients achieve.
 One specific outcome.]

I share this because I want you to know: the advice in these emails
comes from real experience — mine and the hundreds of people I've
coached through career transitions.

Hit reply and tell me: what's the #1 thing you're struggling with
right now in your career?

I read every response.

Izzy

## Email 3: Best Content / Quick Wins
**Send:** Day 4
**Goal:** Deliver concentrated value, show breadth of expertise

```
SUBJECT: The 3 things every job seeker needs to know
PREVIEW: I wish someone had told me #2 years ago

---

Hey [First Name],

I've distilled [time period] of career coaching into 3 things I wish
every job seeker knew from day one:

**1. [Key insight about job search strategy]**

[2-3 sentences explaining it. Make it specific and counterintuitive
if possible.]

**2. [Key insight about personal positioning]**

[2-3 sentences. Include a concrete action they can take.]

**3. [Key insight about mindset/resilience]**

[2-3 sentences. Make it human and empathetic.]

These aren't theoretical — they come straight from coaching sessions
with people who are now working in roles they love.

## Email 4: Social Proof
**Send:** Day 6
**Goal:** Build credibility through client results, show what's possible

```
SUBJECT: From 200 applications to hired in 6 weeks
PREVIEW: What [anonymized name] did differently

---

Hey [First Name],

I want to tell you about [Anonymized Name].

[INSERT: Client transformation story. Structure:

 Paragraph 1 — The "before." Where they were when they started.
 Paint the struggle. Make the reader see themselves.

 Paragraph 2 — What we worked on. 2-3 specific strategies or
 mindset shifts. Be concrete enough to be useful.

 Paragraph 3 — The "after." The specific result. Numbers if
 possible (interviews, offers, timeline).]

Why am I telling you this?

Because [Anonymized Name] isn't special (sorry, [Name]). They were
in the exact same spot you might be in right now. The difference
was having a system and someone in their corner.

If any of this resonates, hit reply. I'd love to hear your story.

Izzy

## Email 5: Methodology / Framework
**Send:** Day 8
**Goal:** Teach your unique approach, position as expert with a system

```
SUBJECT: My framework for going from stuck to hired
PREVIEW: The 4-step process behind every success story

---

Hey [First Name],

After working with hundreds of career changers, I noticed a pattern:
the ones who succeed all follow a similar path (whether they know it
or not).

I turned that pattern into a framework:

**Step 1: [Name of step]**
[What it involves. 2-3 sentences. Make it specific.]

**Step 2: [Name of step]**
[What it involves. 2-3 sentences.]

**Step 3: [Name of step]**
[What it involves. 2-3 sentences.]

**Step 4: [Name of step]**
[What it involves. 2-3 sentences.]

This week, try just Step 1. [Give a specific micro-action.]

If you want to go deeper, that's exactly what we do in the
[program name] — but more on that later.

For now, just start with Step 1.

Izzy

P.S. On [day], I'm going to share something I haven't talked
about publicly before. Keep an eye on your inbox.

## Email 6: Soft Pitch
**Send:** Day 10
**Goal:** Introduce coaching offer naturally, address objections

```
SUBJECT: Is this you?
PREVIEW: If 2 or more of these sound familiar...

---

Hey [First Name],

Be honest — do any of these sound like you?

- You know you need to make a change, but you don't know where to start
- You've been applying to jobs but hearing nothing back
- You feel qualified but can't seem to communicate your value
- You're overwhelmed by all the conflicting advice online
- You've been putting off updating your resume/LinkedIn for months

If you checked 2 or more, you're exactly who I built [Program Name] for.

**What it is:**
[2-3 sentences describing the program]

**What you get:**
- [Benefit 1 — specific deliverable]
- [Benefit 2 — specific deliverable]
- [Benefit 3 — specific deliverable]
- [Benefit 4 — community/support element]

**Who it's for:**
[1-2 sentences describing ideal client]

**Who it's NOT for:**
[1 sentence — shows you're selective, builds trust]

[CTA: Link to learn more / book a discovery call]

No pressure. The weekly emails aren't going anywhere — you'll keep
getting value every [day] either way.
