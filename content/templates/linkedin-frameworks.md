# LinkedIn Content Frameworks

A complete reference for creating LinkedIn posts, carousels, articles, and polls.
Each framework includes the structure, a fill-in-the-blank template, and guidance
on when to use it.

---

## Text Post Frameworks (150-300 words)

Best for: daily posts, quick tips, hot takes, stories, engagement.
Post 3-5x per week. First line is everything — LinkedIn truncates after ~210
characters, so your hook must earn the "...see more" click.


### 1. PAS — Problem, Agitate, Solve

**When to use:** Addressing a common pain point your audience faces.

**Structure:**
```
[Hook — name the problem in one punchy line]

[Problem — 1-2 sentences: "Here's what happens..."]

[Agitate — 2-3 sentences making the reader feel seen.
 Use "you" language. Describe the frustration.]

[Solve — 3-5 bullet points or a short paragraph.
 Specific, actionable, immediately useful.]

[CTA — question or invitation to engage]

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

**Fill-in template:**
```
[Pain point] is costing you [consequence].

You [describe the struggle]. You [describe the frustration].
And the worst part? [Twist that makes it feel personal].

Here's what actually works:

1. [Specific action]
2. [Specific action]
3. [Specific action]

[Closing insight or reframe]

What's been your experience with [topic]?

#careerchange #jobsearch #careertips
```


### 2. Story-Lesson

**When to use:** Sharing a client win, personal experience, or illustrative anecdote.

**Structure:**
```
[Hook — set the scene in one line. Create curiosity.]

[Story — 3-5 sentences. Concrete details: names (anonymized),
 numbers, emotions. Show, don't tell.]

[Pivot — "Here's what I learned:" or "The lesson?"]

[Lesson — 2-3 actionable takeaways]

[CTA — "Has this happened to you?" or "Save this for later."]
```

**Fill-in template:**
```
[Time reference], [person] came to me with [specific situation].

They had been [struggling with X] for [time period].
[One vivid detail that makes it real].

We [what you did together — 1-2 sentences].

[Time later], [the result].

Here's what made the difference:

- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]
- [Insight 3]

[Broader takeaway for the reader]

[Question for engagement]
```


### 3. Listicle

**When to use:** Sharing multiple tips, mistakes, or lessons. High save rate.

**Structure:**
```
[Hook: "X things that Y" or "X mistakes I see..."]

1. [Point] — [one-line explanation]
2. [Point] — [one-line explanation]
3. [Point] — [one-line explanation]
(5-7 items)

[Wrap-up line — the meta-lesson]
[CTA]
```

**Fill-in template:**
```
[Number] [things/mistakes/lessons] every [audience] needs to know:

1. [Item] — [Why it matters in one sentence]
2. [Item] — [Why it matters in one sentence]
3. [Item] — [Why it matters in one sentence]
4. [Item] — [Why it matters in one sentence]
5. [Item] — [Why it matters in one sentence]

The common thread? [Overarching insight].

Which one surprised you most?
```


### 4. Hot Take / Contrarian

**When to use:** Challenging conventional wisdom. High comment rate.

**Structure:**
```
[Bold claim that goes against the grain]

[Why most people believe the opposite — 1-2 sentences]

[Your argument — evidence, experience, examples]

[The nuance — acknowledge when the conventional view IS right]

[Restate your position. Invite debate.]
```

**Fill-in template:**
```
Unpopular opinion: [Conventional advice] is [wrong/outdated/incomplete].

Everyone says [the common belief].

But after [your experience/credential], here's what I've actually seen:

[Evidence point 1]
[Evidence point 2]
[Evidence point 3]

Now, [caveat — when the conventional view works].

But for [your audience], [your recommendation].

Agree or disagree? Tell me in the comments.
```


### 5. How-To / Tactical

**When to use:** Teaching a specific process. High save and share rate.

**Structure:**
```
[Hook: "How to [achieve result] in [timeframe/steps]"]

Here's the exact process:

Step 1: [Action] — [Brief explanation]
Step 2: [Action] — [Brief explanation]
Step 3: [Action] — [Brief explanation]

[Pro tip or common mistake to avoid]

[CTA: "Save this and try it today."]
```


### 6. Before/After

**When to use:** Showing transformation. Works for resumes, LinkedIn profiles, mindset shifts.

**Structure:**
```
[Hook: "Before vs. After" or a dramatic comparison]

Before:
- [Old state 1]
- [Old state 2]
- [Old state 3]

After:
- [New state 1]
- [New state 2]
- [New state 3]

What changed? [The key insight or action]

[CTA]
```

## Carousel / Document Post (8-12 slides)

Best for: step-by-step guides, frameworks, before/after comparisons, checklists.
Post 1-2x per week. Highest save rate of any LinkedIn format.

**Slide structure:**
- **Slide 1:** Hook headline — large, bold, attention-grabbing. Include a visual.
- **Slide 2:** Problem statement or "Do you ever..." question.
- **Slides 3-8:** One key point per slide. Large text. Keep under 30 words per slide.
- **Slide 9:** Summary checklist or key takeaways.
- **Slide 10:** CTA — "Follow for more" / "Save this" / "Share with someone who needs this"

**Design tips:**
- Use consistent brand colors and fonts
- One idea per slide — if you need two sentences, it's two slides
- Use arrows, numbers, or icons to guide the eye
- End every carousel with your name/handle for shareability

**Fill-in template (slide-by-slide):**
```
SLIDE 1: [Number] [Things] to [Achieve Result]
SLIDE 2: Most [audience] struggle with [problem]. Here's the fix.
SLIDE 3: #1 — [Point]. [One-sentence explanation.]

```

## Poll

Best for: audience research, sparking engagement, testing content ideas.
Post 1x per week max. Always follow up on results.

**Structure:**
- Question: Clear, specific, relevant to your audience
- 3-4 options (not yes/no — make them interesting)
- Add context in the post body: why you're asking, what you'll do with results
- Follow up with a post sharing the results + your take

**Fill-in template:**
```
[Question about a real decision your audience faces]

[Brief context — why this matters]

Vote below:

[Option A — specific choice]
[Option B — specific choice]
[Option C — specific choice]
[Option D — "Other (tell me in comments)"]

I'll share what I've seen work best in [timeframe].
```

## Long-Form Article

Best for: deep-dive topics, SEO, establishing authority. Post 1-2x per month.

**Structure:**
1. Headline (8-12 words, benefit-driven)
2. Opening hook (2-3 sentences — story, stat, or bold claim)
3. The problem (why this matters now)
4. Your framework / approach (the meat — use headers, bullets, examples)
5. Case study or example (make it concrete)
6. Action steps (what to do Monday morning)
7. Closing + CTA

## Hashtag Strategy

### Primary (use on every post):
`#careerchange` `#jobsearch` `#careercoach` `#careertips`

### Secondary (rotate by topic):
`#linkedin` `#networking` `#resume` `#interviewing` `#salarynegotiation`
`#careeradvice` `#jobseekers` `#personaldevelopment` `#professionalgrowth`

### Rules:
- 3-5 hashtags per post (more looks spammy)
- Place at the end, not inline
- Mix high-volume (#jobsearch ~2M followers) with niche (#careercoach ~50K)
