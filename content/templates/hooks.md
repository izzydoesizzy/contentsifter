## By Platform

### LinkedIn (first line — max ~210 characters before "...see more")
The goal: earn the click to expand. Be specific, be bold, create a gap.

- "I got laid off 3 months ago. Today I accepted an offer at my dream company. Here's exactly what I did differently."
- "Your LinkedIn headline is a billboard. Most people use it as a tombstone. Here's the fix."
- "Unpopular opinion: cover letters aren't dead. They're just being written wrong."
- "97% of job seekers skip this step. It's the reason they don't get callbacks."
- "I made one change to my LinkedIn profile and got 5 recruiter messages in a week."

### Newsletter Subject Lines (6-10 words, 40-60 characters)
The goal: get opened. Compete with 50+ other emails in the inbox.

- "The 6-second resume test (are you passing?)"
- "What I wish I'd known before my career change"
- "Why your network isn't working (and the fix)"
- "The email that got my client hired"

- "A hiring manager told me something shocking"
- "Your job search isn't broken. Your strategy is."
- "The LinkedIn trick that changes everything"

### Video Hooks (spoken — first 3 seconds, 10-15 words max)

- "Here's the email that got my client the job."
